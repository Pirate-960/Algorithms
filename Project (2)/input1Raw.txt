@@36014786 @5014786/ <h> Millenials and Model Trains <p> Found an interesting article regarding millenials and how they are increasing activity in trade type jobs . So maybe the narrative that they do n't like to use their hands and therefore would have no interest in model trains is not so accurate . I see this all around me , and believe that many will very much be interested in and carry on this hobby and others like it . <p> Like anything I think it 's better to try and understand this generation and what their likes and desires are than to write them off . I believe this hobby has a lot of potential with this younger generation . <p> I agree on trying to understand this generation since our two daughters and two sons-in-law are millennials . The four of them average 38 years younger than me , so there could be quite a ' generation gap ' , the term used when I was their age . Actually the four of them are all doers and I learn a lot form them . Now if I could get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only a passing interest to keep me happy ! <p> Would suggest Lionel already has a strategy to tap Millennial interest with LionChief and smartphone apps . Have a ton of free trains Millennial son declined in favor of spending his own money on the latest and greatest offerings . <p> That is very interesting and a faint flicker of hope , for the " classic " tactile hobbies . But for model railroading specifically , it is only one piece of a bigger puzzle . Some train buddies and I had a nice conversation about the fate of the hobby this past Sunday morning . <p> One of the elements that I like to cite is the state of real railroading today , and how times have changed in our lifetimes , and more specifically since 9/11 . Most of us around the table had stories about being approached by railroad security . <p> With all of the other time and money sucking activities of the modern world , it is very hard to plant that seed and have it grow into the " trainsanity " that many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bit going forward , we are still looking at a lost generation , maybe two . <p> Not trying to be a pessimist here , just a realist . <p> On a related note , one that has also come up repeatedly here on the forum , there was talk of the owner of the largest hobby shop in the area possibly wanting to retire . Just another sign of the times . <p> A great deal of bandwidth has been expended to considering the young people in the hobby . <p> The real question that must be asked ( but I doubt can be answered ) is this alone : <p> What 's the percentages of the population that is into trains ( both real and model ) in any given generation , and has that percentage risen or fallen over time ? If you can answer that , then alone will you be able to answer the overall question . <p> I think it 's silly to think anyone between kid and middle age is going to be into the hobby . How many 20-somethings have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , most are working their way up through jobs that pay very little at first , and gaining ground with their own economics . A friends of mine who was a real old-school modeler in the 50s told me a long time ago that even then , most people in the hobby were kids or middle-aged or older . Not a lot of young adults even in the golden age ' he told me . <p> It seems the parents of the mills were into having these children being involved in things as sports to the rate of former USSR athletes . Many were not exposed to hobbies , or worse , they were evil to the false-goal of the parents . <p> What 's the percentages of the population that is into trains ( both real and model ) in any given generation , and has that percentage risen or fallen over time ? If you can answer that , then alone will you be able to answer the overall question . <p> I 've met plenty of older folks that were never into trains ( maybe their parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were n't interested ) . <p> With the sharp decline in the use of railroads years ago , the exposure of people to trains has done the same . I think the number of people interested in the hobby is directly related to that . <p> Prices are a concern too , when I was growing up in the 90 's you could go to Walmart and buy a $30-$40 HO train set off the shelf from Bachmann or Tyco or whatever . Nowadays I ca n't find a new starter set for under $300 . <p> I 'm a millennial ( 25 years old ) and I absolutely love collecting and operating trains . I have an extensive 3rail O scale collection focused mainly on streamlined passenger trains from the 1930s to the 1950s . I am building my 3rd layout right now which will end up being roughly 40x20 and feature a 4 track mainline representative of the NYC 's " Water Level Route " . It will include my first attempt at building a helix and have multiple levels of staging tracks as well . Likewise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to accommodate my scale passenger cars . 3RS is my favorite of the many types of train/hobby items I own ... <p> I also have a decent postwar Lionel collection , a HUGE Lionel HO collection ( ' 57- ' 62 ) , a bunch of tyco US1 slot trucks , a marklin digital HO collection , a good amount of postwar AF , some Kato N gauge , and finally a small collection of Lionel OO gauge . <p> I also enjoy buying and selling at local train shows and visiting hobby shops when I travel . If you are in the St. Louis area , you can find me at the Great Train Expo ( or whatever it is called now ) the 3 times a year it is in town . <p> Do n't believe millennials like trains ... LOOK AT MY YOUTUBE CHANNEL ! ! ! You old timers are n't the only ones who play with trains <p> I hate to call myself a Millennial ( I 'm 31 ) . I grew up playing with my dad 's Post War Lionel .

Although I never met him since he passed before I was born , my mother still blames him for me becoming a cop . I work in a town where the Lehigh used to come through . Every shift I drive the streets where the station and rails were and am always fascinated with what once was . Reading and Northern lines are nearby . As a matter of fact their police department has backed me up once or twice . <p> As far as this hobby , I 've just recently gotten into it - since the beginning of the year . Right now focusing mostly on PRR and Reading . I 'm sure Lehigh Valley will be added into the mix in the future . There 's no doubt this is not a cheap past time . I do have the Legacy and MTH systems , but the idea of running these things through WiFi currently does absolutely nothing for me .

Starting next Monday they go 9 am to 6 pm mon thru Thursday and 9 to 8 on frida I forget sat n sunday <p> 28 yrs old and I love trains . I pretty much only collect Atlas 2 rail rolling stock so I think that some young people do n't have the patience to wait months or even years for a pre ordered product to arrive unless it 's the latest iphone or xbox . I almost gave up on trains all together after 2-3 years of waiting for all the atlas California Zephyr cars to be released . <p> It 's not just us . A pal of mine was huge into Ham radio and he swears that is almost completely dead . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swear the hobby is as strong as it ever was . <p> Ask a room full of anyone into something specific , of course they 're going to mostly say they know plenty of people into their hobby . Naturally , as people are inclined to be with people into the same stuff they are ! <p> Model train people are the worst judge for if the hobby is staying the same or in decline . You need someone external and objective to really determine that . <p> But how you 'd do that is beyond me . But anecdotal evidence ( at best ) on a model train forum is an utter waste of bandwidth in regard to actually answering the question ! <p> I 'm a millennial ( 20 ) that works in the trades who also volunteers at a railroad museum and collects model trains . <p> I keep seeing " fate of the hobby " like at some point every kid with an iPhone will pitch grandads old trains in a dumpster and no one will ever buy a Lionel set again . Speaking from my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tons of passion for the world of modeling and railroading . It 's a matter of channeling that passion into something productive weather it be a layout of their own or researching and learning about model trains . Now I totally understand why some young people do n't engage with this hobby . A lot of young people do n't have space or the funds for a layout nor do they have access to model railroading clubs either . It 's a matter of keeping interest whilst working with what they have . <p> I do n't mean to be rude but seeing comments above insinuating that younger people are not interested in the trades or hard labor is outright pessimistic and shows either plain ignorance or keeping to a narrow mindset . If you keep to the ideals of " oh man lazy youngsters do n't wan na do THAT ! " Then that really wo n't help encourage them to want to do that now will it ?

Kids wanted them after movie and books . But kids nowadays after watching it around circle 10 times are done . If you ca n't put up a decent layout with operating accessories and remote controls , they loose interest quick . I feel like this hobby needs a new movie based train or something every couple years to boost it.After selling most everything I had from a child to buy a house , get married and have two kids I 'm now putting up a 9 x24 ft layout for my son who 's 3 . He loves Thomas and polar express . I 'm going to put every mth and lionel accessorie on there I can fit lol . <p> I 'm 30 years old and have been going to my uncles train store since I was 8 .

I 'm a sprinkler pipe fitter and I 'm usually youngest out in field on my jobs . Even in other trades I see helpers start but do n't last long . It 's definitely a different time /era . Most people my age want a desk job . I really hope this hobby keeps trucking . <p> I am what people consider a " millennial " at 30 years old .

I do have the polar express set that my 5 year old loves to run at full speed all the time or in reverse . I plan on eventually building a layout on the main level of our house that will be a winter themed layout , have n't figured out where yet . As far as the longevity of the hobby , one can never know for sure , things constantly go up and down . The one thing I would like to see more of is 19th century steam engines , that is the only steam engine my wife likes , not to mention I do n't see a lot I would like to get in the catalogs . <p> This gets talked about a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do about it . This area is full of abandoned rail lines and the general public rarely see a train ... l do n't unless l am driving under an interstate viaduct and one is passing over . Only in the most populous urban areas do many actually get to ride a commuter train , that is not a nostalgic tourist operation . Kids today do not grow up hanging out at the station just as l did n't go through school using a laptop .

I had the train in a box during the layover . So I think my life in the hobby is a foreshadowing of what many young adults may experience in their lives . 175854 @qwx375854 175853 @qwx375853 <h> Block 175862 @qwx375862

I am seeking advise . <p> My wife and I , along with our 11 year old daughter and 10 year old son will be traveling via the Coast Starlight from LA to Emeryville CA , stopping to three days in the Bay Area , then Emeryville CA to Seattle . After two days in Seattle we 're heading east on the Empire Builder to East Glacier for three days in the park , then east again on the Empire Builder to Chicago . <p> This 3710 mile trip will by my wife and kids first on a train , and my first in 29 years . We made the leap , booked two roomettes throughout , and are looking forward to the journey . <p> HOWEVER <p> What do we need to know ? What are the tips and tricks to a successful trip on Amtrak ? <p> Do you have upper or lower roomettes ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facilities , but are noisier in my experience , especially on the ends above the trucks . You may sleep better , and have a better view , in upper roomettes . From Seattle to Glacier Park , left side of train is more scenic IMO . <p> Here 's another perspective : We traveled from Chicago to San Francisco on the Colorado Zephyr in 2001 . Four of us ; we reserved one of the family bedrooms on the lower level ends of the Superliner cars . Great trip . The family bedrooms are bigger than the upper level rooms , and I learned something very important only last year , when we repeated the trip without kids , in an upper level room . There 's a LOT , and I mean a lot , less " sway " and movement in the lower level , since you 're much nearer the center of mass . I 'd always thought that the upper rooms would be way cooler . Nope ; I hardly slept between Chicago and Oakland . If I had it to do again , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The fact that you are breaking the trip up into segments with long layovers is a good start . This gives you a little more flexibility if trains are n't running on time . The leg from Glacier to Chicago is a long one . It is also the one that may not run on time when you get back on at Glacier . It would be a good idea to have some snack supplies on hand , as on board concessions are limited and expensive . <p> We have traveled exclusively by train for years even going cross country via Amtrak . We always book a bedroom . Its expensive but we appreciate the private bathroom and extra space . Roomettes are fine too and IMO upstairs rooms on the Superliners are preferable . You will need to arrange with the sleeping car attendant the time that you want the beds put down . They must be put down before 10 PM when the service officially ends . It is customary to tip the attendant ( formerly the porter ) . We tip $5 in the evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is made in the near the center of the sleeper car . If you want ice for the juice just ask the attendant , Meals are included . You will need to make an appointment for dinner in the dining cars . Important Tip : bring a small amount of duct tape and some thin bubble wrap with you . The sleepers are old and sometimes the door rattles , so a piece of bubble wrap helps keep things quiet at night . There are outlets in the rooms so that you can recharge your smart phones or power a laptop . WiFi is available on some trains but not all . Train travel is an easy going stress free mode of travel . <p> Builder of the Hill Lines ( New Delta Lines ) . Recreating history for the model RR community . <p> The best tip I ever received was to TIP your car attendant shortly after you get on the train . It establishes you in the attendant 's mind as someone he or she should pay extra attention to . Your attendant will come around 5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything you may need and take dinner reservations , etc . I always introduce ourselves , present the tip , shake the person 's hand and say something like , " we 're looking forward to traveling with you " . <p> On one of the first trips after we started doing this , I remember sitting in our roomette with the curtain drawn when my wife remarked that she needed more water . It was n't more than a few seconds before a hand with two water bottles came in next to the curtain . We 've never forgotten that one simple gesture . It was on the Empire Builder . If you allow for the inevitable train delays somewhere on the trip , you can relax and really enjoy it . If you have to be somewhere on a tight schedule especially on a long distance train , leave plenty of time for any eventuality . After all , riding the train should be an adventure . <p> Done 6 trips on the Auto-train from Lorton VA to Sanford Fl .

Since the car is a paying customer also , we figured we would save the money on the sleeper accommodations . The crews have always been friendly and professional . The food quality has dropped a bit in the years we have traveled but it 's still good . The trains are getting old so the tape and bubble wrap is a good suggestion to silence a rattle or block unwanted light . <p> Getting through the terminals is a breeze . And obviously since you are on this forum , a great trip for a train nut . Last Summer we were delayed leaving Lorton ( arriving train was late ) , so I passed the time on the end of the platform watching the crew spot the auto-carriers and prepping the engines for the trip south . <p> We traveled from Chicago to San Francisco on the Colorado Zephyr in 2001 . <p> Amtrak #5 and 6 are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zephyr ' and then after 1983 known as the ' California Zephyr ' .

With that said we do have a flight home from Chicago 6 hours after we 're supposed to arrive , is that reasonable or when we 're talking delays it is more than a few hours ? <p> The tickets says roomettes 7 &amp; 8 , so it looks like we 're on top near the stairs , with the roomettes across from each other . <p> The bedrooms with showers and on several legs the family rooms were sold out , so two roomettes seemed like a better choice than coach seats . <p> My wife is going along with all this , knowing how much I have wanted to do it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the details of how it will all work , type of accommodation , meals , bathroom and showers , etc . <p> I have traveled from West Palm Beach FL to Philadelphia PA last summer and it was not that good a trip .

We got a small room with no shower and the price was over $400.00 round trip , however meals were included in the price . If you are on the east coast the tracks can be a bit ruff and you may not get a good night 's sleep on the train . <p> Lee Fritz 175859 @qwx375859 <p> Just completed an east coast round trip on the Silver Meteor . It was our first time on an overnight train trip and we got a full bedroom . Followed all the advice I read online from travelers .

On the way home , the service and food were so bad , I did n't bother tipping anybody . This time our car was much older and had a noticeable odor . <p> I 'd wanted to take the Zephyr one day and had hoped to convince the wife that a train could be like a little traveling hotel . We 're experienced travelers and we 're not hard to please , but our experience was about a 5/10 . I do n't think I 'm going to spend the money for a longer trip .

This deadens the senses enough to make it manageable . <p> The long distance trains like the California Zephyr are a problem for coach passengers because they can and do run out of food . First class is usually less of a problem , because that is where the food goes . <p> Not sure about the 6-hour leeway between arrival in Chicago and flight out .

The kids slept like babies ( they were 10 &amp; 13 at the time ) . I slept pretty well too and somehow missed the tunnel through the Cascades . Overall a very pleasant journey ! <p> I am fairly sure when we 're on board my wife and 11 year old daughter will have one roomette and my son and I in the other .

The breaks between train segments are designed to give them and my wife outside active activities or things that will be especially interesting to them . <p> i hear you loud and clear about my wife , she will get board fast . Need to think through that , although she can be a reader , so again the Kindle to the rescue . <p> We start the journey with a cross country flight to LA a couple days before the train travel starts , staying in Beverly Hills , so the girls are looking forward to that .

Today 's #8 departed Seattle on time , but it originates there . One possible place for delay is at Spokane where it has to meet up with the Portland section . <p> Someone here on the forum turned me onto the Amtrak real time locator.Save this website and take it with you . It will take all of the guess work out of when to show up for the train at all your stops . <p> I agree , six hours for a connection to your flight home may be cutting it close . You are at real risk there if the train is more than 3 hours late . Travel time from the station to the airport could be an hour or more . Airport time allow a couple hours , but it might be quicker . I have n't flown since 1999 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter I do n't ride trains anymore either . I drive everywhere . <p> Bring lots to read . Believe it or not even stunning scenery can get old after a while . <p> To me the meal experience is the best . Since there are 4 of you , you could get your own table but I would recommend against it . Split up and you 'll have a wonderful time getting to meet other passengers over a meal ( it is communal seating I think they call it ) . When you are in your roomette you do n't have the opportunity to meet others . My experience is the people make the trip . They take Amtrak because they want to ! And they 're an interesting group . <p> Check the Empire Builder 's on time record . It is terrible ! With the oil traffic down it may improve , 6 hours sounds iffy to me . <p> The flight out is fairly well set , my wife and I are both professionals and being able to take 2+ weeks away from work is already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mine we 're in a bit of sweet spot with the July 4th weekend being our last few days . <p> From Chicago Union Station to Chicago Midway shows as 20 to 40 mins , we travel by air a lot , generally Holidays especially late are quick through security so I will have to hope that Chicago Midway is like other airports . We 'll also have to hope we 're not delayed more than four hours . <p> Perhaps the holiday weekend will help with the train delay as well as the airport security speed . Last year during the July 4th Holiday weekend , the 8 Empire Builder arrived early in Chicago all weekend . <p> After reading some of these comments , l may continue to confine my U.S. train travel to tourist roads . Some of those trips sound like the really lousy flights l have been on . Although maybe Amtrak makes nobody give up their seat ? 175855 @qwx375855 <p> Apply for the Amtrak credit card , spend the minimum , get the points bonus and book yourself Bedrooms for the Builder leg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a roomette ( unless its your intent to live in the lounge and just sleep in there ) .

Its worth having the bedroom just to have a couch to sit on during the day ( not to mention the bathroom and sink in the room ) . <p> I also do n't  think 6 hours is enough cushion , the builder is notorious for being late . <p> I realize depending upon how much luggage you have this may or may not be a good option .

If the family bedroom or bedrooms had been available for the overnight legs we would have booked them . Sadly those seem to be in high demand , especially during the heavy summer travel months , so perhaps next time ( if there is a next time following this experience ) we 'll be able to book further in advance or travel in less peak period to allow for the bedroom option . <p> Had n't thought about the Amtrak card to boost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well .

They are at the mercy of the owner of the lines that they happen to be on . So , when Amtrak is late , it is n't necessarily Amtrak 's fault . <p> The best advice , PLAN for " what ifs " and leave yourself plenty of extra time . We rode out to Glacier from Chicago on The Empire Builder in 2016 . I drove 400 some odd miles to Columbus , Wisconsin from Indianapolis , IN to intentionally avoid Chicago and the connection with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ runs from Chicago to Indianapolis ? <p> Why ? Because on our return the Empire Builder gets into Chicago around 3 PM and the Hoosier State/Cardinal departs at 5:45 PM . Approximately a 3 hour window . That 's begging for a problem coming from Glacier Park into Chicago . Anything can and has happened . That 's why I drove to Columbus , Wisconsin because my car was waiting for me there regardless of arrival time . <p> Ironically , our train crew screwed up and forgot to let us off--the train was so long our car was n't at the platform--so when the train started rolling forward we were told by our car attendant that it would stop at the platform so we could get off . WRONG ! ! ! We got to go to Milwaukee and then be driven back to Columbus , Wisconsin . YES , Amtrak was entirely at fault . LEAVE YOURSELF PLENTY OF TIME . <p> Before our last trip , I printed the Route Guide for both the Southwest Chief and the Capitol Limited . My wife enjoyed the information contained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ web page . I always carry an employee timetable when riding former Santa Fe parts of BNSF , so that I can tell exactly where the train is by milepost , get the names of long-unused sidings across Colorado , figure how many miles we are from some station , watch out the back door window for the last in-service wigwag on the Transcon ( at Delhi , Colorado ) , etc . The railfan timetables published by Altamont Press are very informative and you still have time to obtain them . They have all stations , sidings , control points , speed restrictions , tunnel and detector locations , and radio frequencies . <p> I just wanted to comment on Amtrak 's " Lateness .

Of course , Amtrak is very political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given the bureaucracy and the requirement to conduct an annual Congressional " fund drive " , they move a lot of trains at high speeds , without incident , day after day .

Occasionally they stub their toe , and it becomes a media event . The Penn Station derailment was the result of careless track maintenance , but , as I said , Amtrak is political and Penn Station is very busy . The track maintenance in the station will be better now , I can guarantee you , because the FRA Track Inspector and Signal Inspector will be paying more frequent visits and will be more critical in their findings . The FRA is political , too , and they are not going to take criticism for the PennStation derailment . <p> I just wanted to comment on Amtrak 's " Lateness . " Amtrak does NOT own any rails .

Other than that , Amtrak is indeed at the mercy of the freight lines for use of their rails in 99% of the trackage they use outside of the NEC . Amtrak has to accept the condition of the rails maintained by the freight lines ( which can cause slowdowns ) , work around the freight lines ' schedules , etc . Much of Amtrak 's delay problems are due to factors beyond their control . 175854 @qwx375854 175853 @qwx375853 <h> Block 175862 @qwx375862

@@36014798 @5014798/ <h> Deciding between LionChief and the conventional transformer starter sets <p> If you were to buy a starter set for a child today , which one would you buy ? It 's a tough choice . I am leaning towards the LionChief because of how powerful the engines are , better smoking ability , better speed control , and obvious play value with the remote and being able to run more than one set at a time . <p> I 'd say Lioncheif , because of what you said , the better features , and if you plan on getting ( or already have ) command , you both can run your engines together . You can also enjoy the trains more when you have the ability to walk around the track , and watch the trains roll by . <p> Also a vote from me for LionChief . I would even venture to predict within five years Lionel will change to LC engines in all RTR starter sets leaving conventional control engines as special order items . <p> You have already listed quite a few reason to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And as Barry said , you should also take a look at the MTH sets as well . They are both a good value , I think more so than the conventional sets . I think either one would be a good choice . <p> One added advantage to the MTH sets are the ability to upgrade to their full DCS control system and use the full features of the PS3 system that are already built in to the set 's engine , and they will also run in conventional mode . I believe all PS3 sets have DCC capability as well . May be unlikely , but you are all set if that should ever come into play ? <p> Of course the Lion Chief set will also run on a Legacy system still using it 's own specific remote ( and not the Legacy remote ) and no added features will be available under Legacy , but I believe some of the Lion Chief sets are less expensive also . As for conventional operation , Lion Chief Plus will run in conventional , but Lion Chief will not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was MTH 's high quality starter sets . My first MTH set was an Amtrak Sunset Limited Set with Protosound . If I was starting out in the hobby again I would go with an MTH starter set like the SD70ACe one . It would be smart to buy something already command equipped to it will still be useful once you expand from the starter set . I like how my Blue Comet starter set locomotive can be operated with DCS like my scale J1e Hudson . LionChief seems good if you just want a train set for the Christmas but it seems like if you wanted to expand to command control it would become useless . <p> While I applaud the direction that MTH took in regard to allowing the user to seamlessly grow into the full DCS system without loosing anything , I would suggest first trying the MTH starter set remote . The reason is that , if I recall correctly , the remote needs to be pointed at the reciever which is the terminal track section and NOT at the engine . While it may seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at nothing or at the loco while pressing buttons . <p> I 'd go with LionChief . Cheaper and more versatile than the transformer sets . LionChief is compatible with conventional control layouts using transformers , and can be operated side by side with command control at fixed voltages , should you later want full command control ( TMCC/Legacy and/or DCS ) . Some of the LionChief sets are quite a bit less expensive than Lionel 's competitors ' sets sparing you money for additional track , scenery , buildings , rolling stock , etc. that will increase the play value . In some cases you can purchase two LionChief sets for about the price of one more expensive ( albeit nicer and command controlled ) set from MTH . That 's particularly cool should you have more than one child playing with this gift . The two sets , if they 're not identical models , can be operated independently , each with its own remote control on a single layout . And this does n't require the purchase of additional command control equipment ( e.g. , Legacy or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LionChief sets . <p> I agree with Barry . MTH is the best choice for a starter ( &amp; up ) set . It can be expanded , is EZ to use , and , IMHO , the best value .

I know many people buying them will just use it for that . My issue is if you actually get into the hobby and decide to invest in command control like Legacy or DCS you can not run it with the actual Legacy remote . I know $300+ is alot of money for a MTH starter set but in the long run if you decide to expand with more locomotives and DCS it makes more sense in the long run . I wish Lionel had an equivalent starter set with Legacy for around $400 to compete with the MTH sets equipped with Protosound 3.0 . <p> " My issue is if you actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control like Legacy or DCS you can not run it with the actual Legacy remote .

The goal of these starter sets is to get new people into the hobby -- people that do not want to spend top dollar . So one of the biggest advantages to the LionChief sets is cost . Like it or not , last Christmas , Amazon was selling both the Polar Express and the Penn Flyer LionChief sets for around $120 . The conventional sets never get down that low . So not only is the LionChief better for play value for kids , it 's also cheaper for the parents to justify the purchase . <p> I also think that the sooner the conventional starter sets go away , the less confusion for the parents . Right now a parent says " I 'm going to buy a Polar Express for Timmy this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the G Gauge set , the conventional O gauge , the LionChief O gauge , and now this year the 10th anniversary LionChief O gauge .

I was just saying in the longterm the MTH set might make more sense if they want to expand from the set further down the road . When I first got DCS it blew my mind how much more expanded the features of the locomotives I had . DCS or Legacy would be a good investment a few years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hobby . Also MTH offers a set with a modern Diesel Locomotive ( SD70Ace ) that you can actually see on a daily basis too . I think Lionel is missing out by not offering a starter set with a modern diesel Locomotive like a SD70Ace or ES44DC . I know they have a set with a GP38 but those are really only used on local freights and in yards . <p> As far as I know there are no LionChief Plus rtr sets offered right now . The LionChief rtr sets do not have the option of conventional control , though the remote will run on a track powered by a conventional transformer set at a constant voltage above 14v ( actually have operated as low as constant 7v ) . As long as you use its dedicated remote all LionChief engines can run on any track configured with any command control system . <p> I run the MTH Remote Comander and both LionChief and LionChief + on my display . <p> While LionChief rtr engines do not have the capabilities of PS2 or PS3 engines included in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LC rtr engines ) I believe the play value for a child is equal if not superior because of the radio frequency remote with LC as compared to the line of sight Remote Commander offered with the MTH sets . <p> I could be wrong but I think that Lion Chief and Lion Chief Plus require can motors . <p> Back in the 1980 's and 1990 's , when QSIndustries ( QSI ) electtronic reverse and sound systems were getting more sophisticated , some operators had trouble with interference generated by open-frame motors . Some motors were electronically " noisy " and others were n't . <p> It may be possible to convert postwar locomotives but I have a hunch that would be a big project . <p> " My issue is if you actually get into the hobby and decide to invest in command control like Legacy or DCS you can not run it with the actual Legacy remote .

Then the original poster is left to sort through a bunch of gobble-de-gook in an attempt to decipher all the rhetoric whilst looking for a simple answer to a simple question . <p> If you 're really looking for value , you really should be doing some due diligence and comparing the Lionel offerings to those offered by MTH . Feature-to-feature . I own both and researched both extensively before buying anything . Here is an excerpt from a post I uploaded in another thread that discusses the MTH Railking R-T-R SD70 Ace set : " Putting aside the Lionel versus MTH debate , this or any review on this type of set should point out that a R-T-R set that offers - a " near scale " locomotive with this level of detail ( many hand applied detail parts , figures - that are also hand painted , etc. ) and the manufacturer 's full complement of technical operation features , and that includes an abbreviated command control as well as being fully command control ready ( all for around the price of a typical starter set from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comparison to the typical R-T-R set .

Peter <p> Lion chief vs conventional control Lionel rtr sets . Both set come with everything you need to set up and run . LC will require batteries but most everything does Christmas morning . <p> The conventional set has a transformer ( 40 watt ) . The LC set has a wall wart ( 36 watt ) . IMHO the transformer is better if you want to later expand . BUT , the LC set has better sounds and the wireless controller .

We have had several buy one engine for each child and away they go without adding anything to Grandpa 's layout . Just run the power up on the ole ZW . I am hoping the RS-3s are available soon - we need more selection in LionChief Plus diesels . <p> To Barry 's point , we sell the MTH starter sets , at $50 off , 2:1 over the LionChief Plus starter sets at $100 off .

Maybe loco to set but not set to set . <p> And I say that agreeing with you that LC+ is the better choice for a kid , most likely . <p> All I can state is my own experience . I went with a MTH starter set for my then 5 yr old son . Full DCS features and a remote which has color coded or numbered buttons for the main features .

This will control all the basic functions of DCS in command mode . <p> In this scenario , I 'd be running TMCC/Legacy for most of my locomotives and using a DCS Remote Commander for my 1 MTH loco , correct ?

Also , if you 're running more than a single train , I 'd run in passive mode , do n't try to pump the track power through the little DCS remote Commander receiver . <p> If have an existing Legacy/TMCC setup installing a TIU in passive mode is the easiest and safest may be get full DCS control . Running a TIU in passive mode eliminates any concern of overdriving the TIU ( 10 amp max ) . <p> This is what I did and it took me all of 10 minutes to get it running . <p> Since you guys are on the topic .

I am just starting and have only one MTH ps2 engine that I bought at a show . I think for me to get started I will probably have to go with something that is a few years older for the value , i.e. MTH DCS Rev L. non usb . I have seen the Legacy remote and MTH remote and legacy looks simpler but I like some of the detail in the MTH engines and they seem to be at a better price point for what one might get who does not have a larger budget . I know this could start a blood bath , but please do n't hold back . <p> I have found out that with a Legacy System , and a TPC 300/400 , with the momentum set at ' M ' , you can have control of DCS engines . For instance if you want station stops , you carefully throttle the ' red wheel ' to the point where the track power is nearly off , then bring it back up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ station sounds sequence . By pressing ' 2 ' on the number pad you may hear different dialog . When you roll the ' red wheel ' down and up again the engine will announce it is leaving the station , and go on its own .

I 've had some fun with this ( Legacy on DCS ) and it 's just amazing how the engine releases steam and goes on its merry way . <p> The easiest and possibly cheapest way to operate an MTH loco is tp add a lionel TPC unit and run your PS2 loco conventionally . <p> Lionels TPC unit was designed with conventional operation of MTH PS1 and 2 locos in mind , it will allow the ability to blow the whistle , ring the bell , fire the coupler and access some of the freight/stationsounds .

You 're not actually running DCS but the MTH mode where some of the DCS features are available Conventional Mode . <p> I still say the easiest and best way is to get the full DCS set and run the TIU in passive mode . All you have to do is connect the track voltage to the OUTPUT of the TIU and run it off auxiliary power ( a Z-500 brick for instance . ) Full DCS , no TIU worries and away you go . 175854 @qwx375854 175853 @qwx375853 <h> Block 175862 @qwx375862

Should a flatbed truck located outside the structure be shown being loaded or unloaded ?

I have located the structure beside a rail siding , with a boxcar spotted beside that long loading dock . The whole scene looks nice . <p> I grew up on a dairy farm in CT . There was a store called Eastern States Supply that was larger than the Walther 's building .

It arrived in 100 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I used to wander through as a little guy ) and we 'd buy 40 bags at a time .

I 'm sure that they did sell farm supplies at the prototype that I 'm modeling , but back in the 80 's when I first saw it , they had grain silos , so I assume they were shipping stuff out too . The following image is n't very good , but it shows you the prototype in several different eras . <p> Here is what I did with my Walthers structure . The extension covers the ' milling operation ' and was built to justify spotting 2-3 covered hoppers alongside per operating session . Also occasional boxcar is received .

Feed supplements , as mentioned , most common purchase . There was a small mix mill on the farm , used to grind corn/oats feed . The supplement contained additional nutrients and protein , important to milk production . A fair amount of dried molasses was part of the supplement . Tough to get buckwheat pan cakes . <p> These buildings , if they had a mill , would have also had a dust collector , as noted in the HO model . The potential dangers related to the mill and dust may have been part of the demise of these local businesses . <p> Neil , in the earlier times many farm supply stores started out as mills where besides hardware and other farm stuff they sold their own feed .

@@36014805 @5014805/ <h> Difference between isopropyl &amp; rubbing alcohol <p> I see references to using alcohol for stripping paint and cleaning track , etc . There are 2 types , rubbing and isopropyl . I am wondering what the difference between the 2 are and which type is better for both stripping paint and cleaning track . <p> Rubbing alcohol , or isopropyl alcohol , typically is 70% alcohol and 30% water , and it also is available as 91% alcohol/9% water , which is why it does n't burn . Denatured alcohol has no water in it , which is why it does burn . I use 91% rubbing alcohol as a wetting agent , in a spray bottle , for use in scenery-making because it evaporates fairly quickly vs. the water/detergent wetting method ( which sometimes takes days ) . For track cleaning fluid on an RL LInes foam roller track cleaning car I use denatured alcohol . I 've not used the 91% for stripping paint . I also use 91% alcohol to lower the freezing temperature of windshield washer fluid . Phil <p> True , denatured alcohol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is significantly different . It it ethyl alcohol ( 2 carbon atoms ) rather than isopropyl alcohol ( 3 carbon atoms ) .

Further , it is " denatured " with a few percent of other alcohols or solvents to render it undrinkable . <p> Ethanol and denatured ethanol both contain water , Ethanol when distilled forms a positive azeotrope and contains at least 4.73% water by weight . <p> Rubbing alcohol means that it is alcohol that is meant to be applied topically ( on the skin ) . It has nothing to do with the chemical composition of the compound . You can find/buy " rubbing alcohol " that is ethanol based . Most rubbing alcohols are based on isopropyl alcohol probably because it 's cheaper . <p> Denatured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alcohols like methanol ( aka wood alcohol ) are " naturally " denatured because of their toxicity . Isopropyl is n't nearly as toxic and has additives to make it less appealing . Ethanol is what is in liqueur and it has the most additives to a ) render it less appealing and b ) to get an exemption from the drinking tax ; - ) <p> The ratio of alcohol to water in % or proof ( %/2 ) affects the flammability . 91% is extremely flammable and even the 70% stuff has a low flash point , 70 degrees . 91% only drops that down to 63 degrees . <p> I think it is unsafe to use any kind of alcohol in track cleaning cars on a layout due to the sparks that sometimes are an inevitable part of crossing switches or dirty contact rollers .

@@36014807 @5014807/ <h> Collecting scale and toy trains ? <p> Hello everyone ! I love collecting toy trains and scale trains too . I really liked Lionel 's different lines of postwar reissues . Also really enjoy modern scale diesels and scale rolling stock to match . To me watching a set from the pwc series roll past Lionel 's operating loaders , unloaders , and Plasticville buildings on a platform where the " grass " is the green paint on the table top is just as cool as watching a pair of GE widecabs pulling a unit coal train past scenery and buildings on a layout done so well that in pictures you ca n't tell if your looking at the real thing or models . I was wondering how many of you enjoy collecting both scale and traditional sized trains . <p> You could put me in that category- though I have a couple scale locomotives in O gauge , most of what I have is traditional . However , I 'm also into HO , and all of it is scale . So yes , I collect and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself a collector , but I operate O scale ( post war and modern Lionel and MTH ) , G scale ( Garden trains ) , Prewar Tin Plate , HO and N gauge trains . Quite a lot to keep up with but it keeps me busy . <p> I collect all of Lionel ... from 1945 to some of the new scale items of today . Also vintage Plasticville , vehicles , etc . <p> I have all the scale premium sets from the past 16 years along with the entire PWC series , and Conventional Classics , and they all work well and look good together . I prefer the toy rail look . Some nice colorful scenery with Plasticville and Lionel accessories . I collect what I like . Whether its Toy or Scale , <p> Most of my trains are O gauge , but there will be the occasional HO and OO , plus I do like standard gauge , G gauge and S gauge . <p> But I run everything from some postwar pieces to all the new Legacy equipment . The majority of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ era ( 1987-1995 ) , and those pieces feel like a good combination of scale and toy . <p> Bill : I started with my father collecting Lionel PW and still acquire occasional PW Items mostly now modern scale and tradtional with the power being 1st and 2nd generation diesel and steam normally with the big red Keystone on them ( PRR ) . Someday will have another layout to run them on . <p> I started in HO , so I still collect certain scale pieces there . No layout , so it 's pure collecting . <p> I switched to N scale in college and amassed a large number of scale locomotives and freight cars , with an occasional nod to some of the early N scale toy trains , in 20 years and am still selectively adding to the collection . I still have my original N scale layout , so it 's not strictly a static collection . I do occasionally run the trains . <p> I at first delved slowly into three-rail O gauge in the early 1990s , and then it became my principle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a display collection , per se . I run the scale stuff at a club and O-27 stuff ( and short scale stuff ) at home . <p> if you read early articles about model trains , it wo n't take you long to gather that more realism was always the goal of this hobby , but it took a number of decades before technology caught up . HO models could not exist in the 20 's because fractional hp electric motors were n't small enough yet . price effective details through plastics could not exits in the 40 's because the processes were yet to be commercially viable for toys . even scale brass models took about 4 - 5 decades to evolve into the super detailed and smooth running models currently available . <p> i collect and run old " toy " trains because they are part of the history of the hobby . i collect and operate some much newer and more realistic models because , like the pioneers of the hobby , that is also my goal . probably why i remain puzzled at the fascination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far more discerning when it comes to my trains . In the early 80 's I gave up all other scales to focus on 3 rail O. Then in the early 2000 's I took the final step to only scale equipment . I have tons of stuff that I will never use again , and would love to get rid of . <p> I really do n't collect , but I have a mix of all modern command control Railking Imperial and Premier stuff with a few Lionel scale pieces thrown in . Since getting back into the hobby in 2011 , starting with a couple of MTH ready to run sets , I am now slowly switching to all scale sized train items . Still have a few of the smaller RK items though . I do n't have any prewar or postwar items , it 's command control only for me . <p> I originally got involved enjoying many of the modern versions of PW classic pieces in the late 1990 's ( Century Club I as an example ) . I also liked the addition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more of a PWC fan than Conventional Classics fan for this reason ) . So I like PW style trains , but have maybe only one or 2 insignificant actual PW pieces ( think I have a single stop signal and maybe a track cleaner car I bought because of the Jim Barrett article on how to modify one ) . <p> I also like a lot of the modern scale pieces or sets , but I 'm not by any means counting the rivets . <p> So I think I qualify as liking both . <p> Not to derail the original question , but back to the concept of condition , the recent downturn ( IMO ) of initial quality out of the box is causing me to re-evaluate many pre-orders . <p> I collect/operate Lionel Legacy 3Rail Scale equipment , strictly O Guage , and mix the rolling stock with MTH , ATLAS O , and also have TMCC , ATLAS O Masterline Engines ... I really like the Realism Offerred today ... I also have LGB Trains running high on the walls of my train room ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although I do n't consider myself a collector - even tho ' I have a few hard-to-find items . I also pick up some MTH passenger cars , a few Pecos River cars and a bit of Marx for pure nostalgia .

Whatever floats your boat , as they say , as long as it 's not putting the family into a hobo shack ... <p> I 'm far more discerning when it comes to my trains .

As for scenery with accessories , buildings ect. , I have a mixture of both toy like Postwar Lionel stuff and realistic items . To me the traditional accessories , ect look fine next to more realistic items .

General Mills , under Lionel MPC , recognized this and began producing trains not only for the mass market in terms of cheaper train sets , but also in products that were meant to appeal to the adult collector . Richard Kughn recognized that even more and thus further enhanced the product line under LTC . <p> So before the arrival of MTH into the marketplace , there was a strong adult collecting community that especially adored the traditional toy trains . <p> Mike Wolf did force Lionel and the hobby in general to shift toward a scale orientation . There must have been some demand for that approach , otherwise it would n't have continued until this day . <p> So , NSBill , you 're not alone . Lots of people like both seeing traditional-sized trains on green-paint grass layouts as well as scale equipment on realistically scenicked landscapes . In the three-rail realm , I have never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unmatched by any other segment of model railroading , and it 's obvious others feel the same way . Heck , I wish I could afford to buy a prewar Lionel Standard Gauge Blue Comet set just to display .

@@36014809 @5014809/ <p> Remember , with DCS both the app and the remote tell the TIU to send a command to the loco . The loco does n't know who told the TIU to do it , and the TIU does n't care whether the order to send the command comes from the WIU or the remote . <p> BRIANR has his answer , but for the sake of understanding I thought I might share a little info about DCC that probably lead to his question . In DCC , much like TMCC and Legacy , you only have one command base ( command station in DCC parlance ) , but you can have many remote controls ( a.k.a. cabs ) . One of the ways that many DCC systems try to increase robustness is to continuously re-send the last speed command for each engine . The command station can send commands to over 10,000 locomotive addresses , but it can only keep track of a limited number of locomotive addresses and speed commands ( usually 128 or fewer ) . To reserve a spot in the command station 's memory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its address from a cab . When you do this the command station associates the locomotive address with the acquiring cab number and only that cab can send commands to that address . With DCS , TMCC , and Legacy , you can run an engine from a second remote ( or app ) without any special action , but that 's not the case with most DCC systems . Procedures vary from one brand of DCC system to another , but in most cases you must issue a request to acquire the locomotive from the second cab before you can run it . On some systems the first cab must relinquish control of the engine before it can be acquired by another cab . Just to add extra hoops to jump through , many DCC systems require you to physically plug the cab into a hard wired command bus terminal to acquire an engine . Imagine tethering your DCS remote to the TIU every time you wanted to pick a different engine from the engine list ! <p> The up side to this convention in DCC is that multiple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down side is that handing off an engine from one operator to another is a bit of a hassle . 175854 @qwx375854 175853 @qwx375853 <h> Block 175862 @qwx375862

In the past , I used under the track contactors , such as the 153C to operate these accessories , but I 'm not sure this is the best option for ballasted and screwed track .

Joe , I gave a quick look at the Circuitron website and it looks like a fine company with user friendly advice . I think I 'll be spending some time reading about their products . <p> As to the insulated track sections , I might go with this route depending upon the cost of the more advanced electronic options . <p> The Lionel 153IR send an infrared signal across the track which is reflected back by a passing train . It comes with a connection to clip directly onto Lionel tubular track . Looks good too . I 've just bought a 153 Block Signal and a 151 Semaphore and I 'm planning on experimenting with using the 153IR instead of the supplied 153C contactor. 175852 @qwx375852 <p> I use the insulated rail method exclusively , just because ( 1 ) I 'm an old relay type of guy , and ( 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms of being able to activate and hold a condition , ability to create slow-activate - slow/release situations and the ability to eliminate chattering/flickering of accessories by using D-C relays with filter capacitors . <p> Thanks for the additional suggestions . Helpful to see the Lionel video on use of the 153IR unit . Actually , I like the look of the electrical cabinetry ... it 's the price for multiple units that does not impress me . I may go with one or more of these depending upon the accessory and scene , but I think I may use the insulated rail for most of the accessories . <p> I am also interested in use of other electronic items with the insulated rail to minimize the chatter of many of the vintage Lionel accessories . Arthur , can you provide more details on these items ( relays/capacitors ) ? <p> I am also interested in use of other electronic items with the insulated rail to minimize the chatter of many of the vintage Lionel accessories . Arthur , can you provide more details on these items ( relays/capacitors ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasonably priced . I have some further info and thoughts . <p> After considering my layout , vintage accessories , and interests , most probably I will link the 153 block signals to my switches for sidings to highlight the position of the switch . I am fairly certain this is possible , and it eliminates the need for trackside activation . I have several units of the 145 gateman and 152 crossing gate , but will probably use only 2 of each due to space limitations ( even though these are noisy and not to scale , got ta have them - grandkids love em ) . In each location , I will link the gateman and crossing gate to work concurrently . So in the end , I will probably need only two activation mechanisms for the gateman and crossing gates . I also like to have these activated before the train reaches the units so that they are in operation by the time the train is there . It appears that the 30100 Insulated Track Signal Device will do the trick . <p> Question : I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chatter of the solenoids in these units . True ? Does the 30100 accomplish this ? <p> Yep , one significant benefit of the track sensor was specifically to eliminate contact bounce chatter issues . You can use a plain AC relay if you do n't worry about contact bounce . However , my goal with this design was to use very low current to activate the relay to minimize the power consumption as well as any arcing as the insulated rail section is entered . <p> As you can see , the 30100 ( aka ITSD ) was developed with a lot of input from the OGR community . In addition you can see exactly what you 're getting with component-level drawings/schematics . The sometimes overlooked benefit is if you have a question about how to apply it , there are a lot of guys here on OGR - including GRJ of course - that can help . <p> Thanks for the link to the thread on this issue .

Those white boxes are relays . There are different ways to configure 2 relays to perform the reversing function but , for example , you might here one relay click when shifting from active-to-neutral , and the other relay click when shifting from forward-to-reverse . If the relays are clicking then I do n't think your transistors are an issue . <p> Since you say you are seeing 0 voltage at the motors , did you test or consider the bridge rectifiers ?

@@36014814 @5014814/ <h> Understanding climate control for general storage and when trains are out and running <p> I 've always heard a little bit about this but really think that some of us really do n't fully understand the dangers . I know like everyone else that damp places are a big hazard to trains in general because of the rust possibility . So , what other things are dangerous to our beloved trains ? <p> 1 . General storage in their boxes does hot or cold temperatures pose a great threat ? How about when they are out to run ? <p> 2 . How about in humid environments , what is best for that ? Dehumidifiers or would that not be good either ? <p> 3 . Even though most trains as well as most good are packed with those little silica packets to absorb moisture , is there anything else that would be beneficial ? <p> 4 . What are good things for climate control for your collection throughout the house ? Basement ? Ground floor ? Second floor ? Attic ? <p> 5 . What are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listed them above since I do n't know what is best ? 175852 @qwx375852 <p> My primary concerns would be : moisture ; heat above 90 F for storage ; cold below 35 F for storage ; smoke residue ; animal hair ; and dust/grit ( desert areas ) . Mine stay in the boxes , those without boxes are on shelves with painters plastic hanging in front of the shelves . <p> The small silica packet is usually for the shipping time frame . You can " regenerate " the silica by baking it at about 125 C for a few hours . I noticed de-humidifiers in a lot if train layouts I visited on the south and northeast . Moisture is not a problem in West Texas . <p> My stuff is inside the house so temp conditions is not much of an issue . <p> The train room temp sits in the mid 60 's with a constant humidity ranging from 45% or so up to 55% ... no rusting or other problems yet in 10 years . Got the dehumidifier shortly after doing the bench-work and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hose running from the dehumidifier sump pump to the train room toilet . Not ideal , but it works ! ! <p> When I first installed the dehumidifier the bucket was filling up twice a day , hence the sump pump setup so I do n't have to keep emptying the dehumidifier bucket . <p> I also set up a box fan with a furnace filter on it in the middle of the layout and my dust problems have been minimized . Change the filter every 60 days . It picks up an amazing amount of dust and stuff running on the low speed setting . Very quiet . When the trains are running it 's not noticeable . <p> Steel does not rust when the humidity is kept below 40% . When the temperature drops the humidity goes up , so a constant temperature will help control high humidity . UV light bleaches the color out of plastic , paint and boxes . Avoid sun light and fluorescent lighting . Many flexible plastic wraps can stain other plastics , like Lionel shells . Do not wrap trains in plastic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ train room is in our basement . With vapor barriers on the walls and floor , and a mini-split heat pump that provides heat in the winter and cooling in the summer , the train room is consistently 68-70 degrees and 45-50% humidity all year . No problems so far . <p> No - rather the opposite is - or can be - true . Temperature does not " cause " humidity , but humidity - the relativehumidity is the proper term - can be greater with higher temperatures than with lower . <p> Warm air can hold more moisture than cool air . That does not mean that it is humid - it just means that it can be more humid . Most deserts are hot and dry ( some can be cold and dry - see Mars for an extreme example ) . <p> Where I live has long , hot , wet summers . I have never had any equipment humidity issues in my train building . For 27 years . It is cooled or heated only when I am in it , and not at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but not to be ingnored , high heat melts and speeds up many other chemical reactions including the previous two . <p> Lots of unsealed wood in toolboxes is an old machinists trick for maintaining stable moisture levels pre-air conditioning . <p> From that mostly , I also feel what is overlooked a lot is any fast rising and falling temperatures above 40% can leave steel at cooler temperatures than the air around it , drawing condensation to it . And 40% is n't exactly comfortable for some folk . <p> The amount of moisture drawn to the steel is reletive to the total temperature difference and ca n't usually even be seen easily ; But a heavy beam of sunlight quickly heating the air dirrectly contacting your metal . Because steel will take longer to warm that air , that metal likely sweats like a tall glass of iced tea and then evaporates as the difference stabilizes . <p> I found this out the hardway ; saw the rust forming , and then noticed the light and heated air moving over my arm one day and knew what had happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just a small area of rising heat gusts from sunlight heated air movements happening daily . <p> I now find temp . stability and any change . being very gradual , of great concern . With this in mind if you are really serious about things , but do n't  like desert humidity levels , ask your hvac people about if you could be running your system as a contant air circulation system ( fan always on , but usually wired at a lower rpm rate ) , any area will be more stable from a constant circulation of conditioned air , and more sample air across the sensors triggering the hvac mode mean more accurate heat/cool reactions and less cycling ( " sensors " ... thermo&amp;humidistats ) <p> Some spaces with big temp variances from room to room can actually be run more cost effiently this way . You have to have a sytem that allows you to experiment , then watch the bills and hope . <p> Here in New England the worst thing I have seen is folks who store trains in uninsulated attics . Very hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the winter . I have even seen attics with icicles hanging from the rafters . Not too uncommon for someone to pull what was grampas pride and joy pre-war toy out of storage only to find it a rusted , locked up hulk which smells like the way grandpa looks . <p> If you are into buying old tin plate , basement finds seem to be better quality than attic finds . <p> Frank Ventura <p> **28;0;TOOLONG <p> ...

@@36014815 @5014815/ <h> York questions and advice <p> Well , its amazing I was able to get days off work and I will be able to attend York in October . My concern is of course hotel accommodations as not sure what is out there . I 'm sure someone will say , " get it booked as soon as possible " , which I do intend to do . My initial plan would be to make it out there **28;30;TOOLONG and relax before the big storm and stay through Saturday whenever the end is then . What should I expect other than what I have described to my coworkers as the World Series , Superbowl , Stanley Cup Finals , and the NBA Finals all rolled into one ? Also plan on signing up with the TCA tonight when I get home as I should have done years ago . <p> That 's really excellent advice ! Do a search for hotels in York on the Internet , lots of choices . <p> I 've stayed at the Wingate , the Wyndham Garden York , the Comfort Inn &amp; Suites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do NOT recommend the Comfort Inn &amp; Suites , it 's right on I83 and it was very noisy all night ! The other places were all fine , the Wyndham Garden York has a bar and restaurant , that may or may not swing the deal for you . <p> You often can get a better price if you book direct with the hotel ( or chain ) , especially if you are over 65 . I have found that doing this let 's you cancel up to 24 hours before arrival with no charge at some hotels . <p> I still have to book yet , was n't feeling well last night so I was n't on . On Saturday , I should check out in the morning I would think since I 'm not staying over into Sunday . How long does it last on Saturday anyway ? I figure as a rough guess that I would be departing for home in the afternoon but not sure 1 , 2 , or 3 or such . <p> Heck , I did n't even get on to get a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken care of tonight . I guess I will need that stuff before getting my York tickets ? <p> I still have to book yet , was n't feeling well last night so I was n't on .

I will get that taken care of tonight . I guess I will need that stuff before getting my York tickets ? <p> Have you ever been to York before ? If not you can show up Wednesday or Thursday morning and go as a guest of Eastern Division for 22 bucks and enjoy the whole show . Alternately you can become a TCA member and then pre register for the whole show for 14 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you do n't pre register it will be 20 bucks at the door even if you are a TCA member . <p> As for hotels we stay at the Homewood Suites . Multi course breakfast plus dinner from Tuesday-Thursday evening including complimentary beer and wine . Keep that in mind when comparing room rates . <p> Although it is advisable to get your reservations now , I also suggest continuing to check for rooms up until a few days before the meet . Due to declining attendance and the building of more hotels , it 's much easier to find a room than it once was . In April , I was able to re-book an existing reservation about a week before the meet and saved about $30 per night . <p> Well , last night I signed up for the TCA , just have to wait for that stuff to come in the mail . I have n't booked the hotel/motel stuff just yet , I need to look at things in a little more detail plus discuss with my co-worker who I will be bringing along as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guess that I am registering myself and my co-worker ( as a guest ? ) and would I need what would be my TCA Membership number or some such thing as well ? <p> My TCA membership came the other day , plus I had to call AAA about my membership with them .

May be able to get a AAA discount on a hotel stay ( at least that is what my sister said about them ) . See if I get time this weekend/coming week to iron this all out ( time is running out ) . <p> I would say if I do n't buy anything at York ( which I know I will ) , that it would be just the experience that makes it all worth while . <p> I would print out maps of the fairgrounds before coming and drive around the grounds on Wednesday to familiarize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most money you are willing to spend at York , then double it , and take that amount in cash in a mixture of large bills and small bills .

Make a list of what you want and research the prices using ebay COMPLETED sales with 2 or more bids .

Try reserving a week before or a week later , the rates are vastly different . <p> The LaQuinta is a nice newer hotel . Before they figured it out the rate was pretty good considering York week . <p> I stayed there in April for $140 a night and when I checked out they changed to a 3 night minimum for October .

I do n't think I 'd stay in a tent , but then again , I might just try it some time . <p> Well , I finally got my hotel accommodations squared away , took all of 10 minutes . Sort of wish I could have taken care of it weeks ago ( always get busy darn it ) . All is left now is to register for York . I suppose either tomorrow night or Thursday I will take care of that . <p> Now you are geared up for the York experience , you will see exactly what a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ train show/meet in the country attended by about 12,000 toy train nuts from around the country and some from other parts of the world . 175854 @qwx375854 175853 @qwx375853 <h> Block 175862 @qwx375862

One thing I may add is that TIU3 is hooked up to the LCS 2. 5 TIU 's all in super mode . Any ideas ? Very frustrating as I was looking forward to using one app for all . Thanks <p> Yesterday at the club , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toggling between Icab and the DCS Premium app .

I added the Y connector and the TPC still works . When I connect the Lionel serial box connecter to the Y connector the TPC does not work . My next step is to buy another Y connector if no one has a better idea . Thanks Bruce <p> Rudy all I can supply is a writen description . Legacy base to supplied Legacy cable . Serial end to Y cable . 2nd Y cable end to serial 2 wire connection to Lionel Track Power Controller . Third end of Y connector to 6-81499 DB9 + 12V power cable that connects to 6-81326 SER2 .

Take a look at the SER 2 manual and review the different examples there . <p> I have not experimented with the MTH product , but I would recommend that all connected serial devices are fed from the SER2 . Perhaps a second SER2 might be necessary to connect all the equipment you have , but in any case the Y cable probably is inappropriate for this configuration . 175854 @qwx375854 175853 @qwx375853 <h> Block 175862 @qwx375862

@@36014821 @5014821/ <h> Important differences between AC and DC Circuit Breakers <p> I had a recent problem with an old ZW transformer that started to smoke , so I read a lot of articles related to ZW circuit breakers here on the forum . I found many good suggestions including adding individual smaller ( about 5A ) circuit breakers on the individual ZW outputs and also adding diodes between the power and ground terminals to protect modern electronics from voltage transients . However in some of the posts ( ca n't recall exactly where I read this ) someone stated that there is really no difference between AC and DC circuit breakers for protecting these old Lionel transformers . That is unfortunately not only incorrect , but could lead to a fire . Here is a link to a very good article on this subject . This article explains how circuit breakers work , the key differences between AC and DC circuit breakers , and why you must make sure the circuit breakers you use on your AC Lionel equipment are AC rated . <p> I read the article and watched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on D.C. circuits.The explanation is interesting , and makes sense to me.However , they do not state that a D.C. breaker can not be used on an A.C. circuit , as might be the case when protecting the output of a Lionel transformer . The voltages we use may be a factor too , <p> This thread may get interesting as the folks more knowledgeable than I make comments . <p> One factor with the design of circuit breakers , ( AC ) , is Amp Interrupting Capacity . ( AIC ) Not so much related to how a circuit breaker works , a combination of electromagnetic and thermal , but if the circuit breaker is capable of opening properly with a high surge applied . Most standard home circuit breakers are rated at 10,000 AIC . Commercial duty circuit breaker/and Main Circuit breakers , can be 25,000 AIC and larger . If a commercial power supply/transformer fails , creating a surge , hopefully household overcurrent protection can open properly . The damage from these types of failure can be catastrophic . <p> I use automotive breakers on my system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expect . If I want to protect a circuit for 10A , I use an 7.5A breaker . A 7.5A circuit gets a 5A breaker . Since these are automotive breakers , they are not rated for AC . I use the lower rating to help compensate for the slow acting properties of the thermal breaker . <p> I researched this before I decided to go this route . What I found is there are many AC/DC breakers out there . But the specs are different . As an example a breaker rated for 120VAC/10A may only be rated for 32VDC/10A . The difference is explained in the OP 's original article . With that said , since the DC voltage rating is always lower than the AC rating , I felt safe testing automotive style breakers . In my opinion , they do their job adequately when the voltage is kept at levels we use on our train layouts . <p> IMHO , the best protection is still the fast blow fuse . I do n't use them as much anymore thanks to my grandkids . I would need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . Magnetic or electronic breakers work well but get very expensive quick . <p> Also remember that a fuse or CB is designed to protect the power . The arcing that occurs when a breaker is tripped causes the transient spikes that a TVS takes care of . Breakers as close to the power source as possible and TVSs as close to our electronics as possible is the ticket IMHO . <p> The article illustrates breakers used in a mains panel as may be used in a large solar array installation ( lots of amps at 48 vDC ) . I doubt any of us would consider going into a hardware store and buying a mains breaker for a layout . <p> The panel mount breakers we typically use for layout power usually have both AC and DC ratings , and the AC voltage rating is generally higher than the DC - probably due to arc breaking considerations as described in the article . <p> ZW breakers are thermal . They heat up and open - hopefully before the shorted load is damaged - but with power routed across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damage is real and repairs expensive . Use a fast acting or instant trip breaker . There are many threads on this forum discussing suitable breakers . I use Airpax instant trip . <p> A thermal fuse will protect analog power in a ZW . It will not protect overcurrent in engines . When I ordered instant trip breakers , the distributor commented that the only use for those is to protect electronics downstream from the power source . That precisely describes our operating environment . <p> I can attest that a thermal breaker in a transformer will not protect traces on circuit boards in an engine derailed and shorted on a switch . <p> If you read the article carefully you will see you can use a DC relay for AC but its not advised to use an AC relay in a DC circuit .

@@36014822 @5014822/ <h> ETS loco stops and starts erratically on FasTrack <p> It will not run consistently on my 9 ' x 12 ' Lionel O36 FasTrack oval with two 10 " straights connecting each O36 curve section in the four turns . I have a Lionel PA-1 diesel and a Williams 4-6-0 that run fine on the same track . The ETS loco has relatively narrow flexible metal blades/shoes for 3rd rail contact . The other two have relatively wide rollers . When I loosened the ETS loco 's shoes to hang further down , the loco worked better but still stalls several times in a circuit . I use an MTH AC Z-1000 to power all trains . At their request , I provided that power information to ETS when they prepared the loco for me . <p> ETS said the loco worked fine in their testing but they did n't have FasTrack .

When I first ran it ( over the Holidays ) , I ran it with out the tender and it was very erratic , cleaned the track and bottom of the engine and it still the same.I put the tender on and tried ( no electrical pickups on the tender , just a tender light with a two wires to the engine ) and it ran fine.My ETS products have knuckle couplers ( Lionel type ) and 4-wheel trucks .

Maybe a DC offset ? When I get a chance I will try it with a postwar transformer . <p> Update . Many thanks to all for suggestions and comments . I bench tested the loco with live wires to 3rd rail pickup shoe and wheel . It worked fine so I knew it was a 3rd rail contact problem . <p> I cleaned the track and loco wheels/pickup shoes thoroughly .

Capillary action will take the glue all the way around the wheel . The tires can be chipped off anytime due to the poor shear strength of CA ... BUT , I doubt this will alleviate the derailing issue ... it will probably make it worse . <p> Your switches are probably too small radius for the design of the diesel if the trucks are swinging those axles out so far . <p> Thanks Rob @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adapted to the sound , so I may just leave it be , it was just unexpected/odd the first time hearing it , but it 's good to know about choices/how to on reducing the noise ; quick note , it makes more chatter on the switch on slow speed than it does at moderate speeds .

It runs on a O48 oval with two O36 connected switches . <p> Just one last question , I promise !

Here 's an example : The Premier Autorack cars made around 2002 or so had a MSRP of about $44.95 and the car has basically remained the same but today the same car style has a MSRP of $89.95 . Many of the early Autoracks are sought after and in many cases a justification can easily be made for asking prices that are significantly above their original MSRP issue prices . This same dynamic is at work for other styles of rolling stock and especially for dummy diesel engines . <p> The adage that " you 'd be lucky to get 50% of what you paid " does n't necessarily hold true . It has n't for me . Engines are a different matter , as the electronics and the perception of them has a very dynamic effect on who is interested in buying and what that buyer is willing to pay .

Not only do I plan to have more time to work on my layout , I would love to do a train ride across the country . The thought of being able to take a vacation and not have to hurry there and back .... sigh . <p> Right now , I get a few precious hours a week . When the grass season comes , it will be even less . So , for those of you that have recently retired , what are your train plans ?

Every weekend off will give me more time 2 ways ....... more actual time and more energy because I wo n't be recovering from 36 hr shifts . <p> I retired last year and as fall came on my wife suggested that I get my trains out of the attic . 45 years of working day and night left little time for my trains . What joy it has been to re-discover this joyful hobby . <p> Little did she realize the results of her suggestion would be the loss of one of her rooms . <p> I took my wife 's advice and retired in 2014 when I turned 62 . We were tired of my always having to work in another state managing construction sites , although it gave us opportunity to see a lot of our country and visit the local sites of interest . Also , I acquired many trains and items from diff areas , pieces I may not locate otherwise and at low , local prices ( antique shops , estate sales , etc . ) . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 7 days a week in refineries , chemical plants , etc. , I was ready and feels great being home all the time . Have not got to spend time on the layout as much as I wish , but have made progress and it is slowly coming along .

But , as stated , do have more time for layout and trains , making use of info and products found here , repairing/upgrading various engines , getting past issues taken care of . LOVE IT ! ! ! ! ! <p> Right now the post-retirement plan is to begin to deal with all the projects I 've started or intended to start . <p> I set a cut off date last June for pre-orders of big ticket items ( greater than $400.00 . ) I still have two pre-orders in orbit and the cash is set aside for them , but otherwise no new pre-orders . I 'll still set aside 20 bucks a week for train things , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cash is available . <p> Hello , I retired 15 years ago but when I was planning it , my wife and I started to plan a move to a more " elder " living place . We selected a condo in her home town close to a golf course ( country club ) which allowed her to be closer to family and old friends and allowed me to walk about 400 yards to the first tee . The condo was still under construction so we could pick options like a semi finished basement in which I could construct a reasonably sized layout . No more trains around the Christmas tree . Therefore , I have a 24 ft by 8 ft layout that has running trains and beautiful scenery ( I got help with the scenery ) . Of course , a layout is never really finished because you always find something you want to improve , such as adding a lighthouse in a corner or add signal lights . <p> Unfortunately , with age , my golf handicap is increasing but I am still having fun with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still working , laid off after 25 years at one spot , then 2 years later disabled do to the dam Cancer and the crap treatment and surgery 's that go along with it . I have all the time in the world now and I am alive with my Trains ! My wife let 's me do as I please as long as I do house work also . <p> I have been retired 5 years after working for 48 . I knew it would be good , I had no idea it would be THIS good . I have more time for trains , that 's for sure and that is a good thing . I 've expanded my layout and go to 2 shows a year instead of 1 ! I also thought I would have beer for lunch every day . I 've done that 4 times in 5 years . Pluses , minuses , like everything in life . <p> I turned 57 , yesterday , and am eligible for retirement after 33+ years on the job . Alas , as my wife and I like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put off retirement until I turn 62 ! <p> Although we have lived in the same house for the last 24 years , this is not our retirement house and we had planned on moving after I retired . Given the fact that it looks like they may start developing the 100 acres next to us in the next 2-3 years , we have decided to try and sell our house this coming Summer . <p> Unfortunately , for the trains , this means the end to my current 11'x17 ' layout and the 12'x15 ' " U " extension ( bench work already built ) . I have spent my free time for the last two weeks cataloging and packing up my trains . This week will be spent taking up my Ross turnouts and Gargraves track ( selling on the forum next week . ) The trains will all be going into climate controlled storage . As we will likely rent a condo or townhouse until I retire , this means the shift to a carpet layout ( Lionel Fastrack ) from my current Ross/Gargraves layout . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As I do n't know where we might live , this could be a bedroom , family room , or hopefully , another basement . <p> Jim <p> Historic Frederick County , Maryland . Modeling both the Reading and B&amp;O Railroads . <p> I retired in 2012 and had a nice layout that I put more time into but most importantly started traveling in Europe for two months a year and riding some of the premier trains that are available and my wife tolerates it as long as we go to places that she wants to see . <p> Been retired for a year now . 66 years old next week ; it 's WONDERFUL ! Drove big truck for Wally World , various work schedules over the years but gone from the house for days on end . Always seemed rushed to finish a project on the layout ; needed to show some progress . There were weeks that went by that I never even went into the train room , that was usually in the warmer months when I had outside activities to do ; enjoying my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting rid of the trains . But now it 's a real joy to be able to go down to the train room and play at my leisure . <p> Worked 46 years as an aerospace engineer/professor . Retired almost three years ago and began building a 10 ' -by-5 ' 3-rail scale layout opposite a 12 ' -by-8 ' layout completed in 2004 . Have recently been posting photos on OGR Forum . New layout is built in two 5 ' -by-5 ' sections with light-weight modular construction to be transportable if we move . Grandkids love to visit and run the trains . Probably another year or so to complete new layout . Still buying some trains - MTH Premier and Atlas O , but no expensive steam engines or Lionel . I have a huge collection already . Hope to keep active in the hobby . <p> I will be 62 this spring and plan on working for at least 3 more years hopefully , The Air Force retired me at 60 after 33 years ( 12 active and 21 reserve ) they said i was too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can stay a few more years . I have slowed down on the scenery of the present layout but I do get to run my trains . The wife and I are planning on moving out of Ct . when I retire and looking possibly down Kentucky or Tenn . The new house either buy or build has 2 very important requirements 1 everything on one floor for the wife ( bed , bath utility etc. ) and 2 a very large open basement for the trains and if no basement I have a 25 ' X 48 ' garage sitting on a pallet that I could use for the trains . <p> I closed my store and retired this year . I am rearranging the basement and getting the train room put together in one end . So far my office and work areas are mostly in and trains stored/displayed . Next is to take apart my old gun-room/dark-room/train storage room which is going to supply some of the material for the layout which is going to sit upon some shelf units that I salvaged from the store @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 67 years old . My current layout in the basement is a couple of sheets of plywood painted green with 031 tubular track . I 've accumulated a lot of newer equipment which requires 072 . My plan is for a new layout , but not sure if it will be in the basement or a spare bedroom . The hard part is tearing down what I have and cleaning up to make more room for what I want . The really hard part is that since I retired I am now staring at all the little projects around the house that were never done or never completed and I have n't had the time to spend on the layout . <p> I retired 13 years ago and was n't happy about it at the time . I had wanted to work at least until I was 70 , but circumstances dictated that it be at 62 instead . I loved my job and was able to balance working with my hobbies . It took me the best part of three years to accept it and get on with my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I seem busier now that when I was working . Way too many things to do and not nearly enough time to do them . I have been blessed with good health , enough income to live comfortably , and a lot of varied interests . <p> Off to the movies to see a film recommended to my wife , then home to work on the layout . My son is coming tomorrow so we should get a lot done then . <p> Best of luck in your retirement , it can be the best time of your life . <p> I retire when I 'm 65 in two months . My biggest train endeavor is major downsizing . I waited all my working life to retire so I could enjoy my acquisitions of a lifetime ( not only trains ) only to realize I 've entered the sudden death heart attack zone . Dah , never thought of that ! Sorry to be Danny Downer , but I know ( knew ) a significant number of guys in their 60 's that have passed . Not fair to leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worry about , at the same time it will be very depressing to " let go " of my toys . Time to learn how the Bay works and/or the best way to handle such an endeavor . Buying stuff is over , and the " hunt " was the second most thrilling aspect with running trains being first . So my " big " train plans in my retirement is to drastically thin the herd- gracefully ! <p> Rich : Perhaps make estate arrangements with one of the brass re-sellers , like Bill Davis or BrassTrains.com , to handle the disposal of your collection . Since they are pros , might net more money then piece-mealing it off on ebay . And gigantically less frustrating for your wife . In the mean time , keep enjoying ALL of your trains ! <p> Retired some years back and wife has 3 years to go to max out at her job her dream is to sell house and buy 1 in Florida which to my understanding has very few basements . <p> I want to make her dream come true in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Illinois winters and would also like space for a bigger than 4x8 layout But i ' m thinking i need a basement . <p> It will definitely be a home in Florida and i think a spare bedroom would be to small . <p> Same here Dieseler - I retired a year ago and the wife wants to , at minimum , downsize here in PA , or move to South or South West . That means my basement size layout will have to come down and I will have " real estate " shock on what space I can carve out of a condo somewhere . <p> I have no plans to retire as long as the Good Lord keeps me healthy enough to work . I enjoy working ( especially the type of work I am lucky enough to be doing ) and want to stay active . I have seen far too many younger-than-I retirees bite the dust a relatively short time after retiring . And I definitely plan to stay active in the hobby , which has significantly helped to keep me healthy up to now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the very near future . By that I mean selling the condo and getting a small single-family home with more space for storage , a decent-size yard , no association fees , and a significantly lower mortgage . Still looking forward to building another garden railroad ( Large Scale ) . I have everything I need for that except the fenced back yard . <p> I will be 65 in August and have been retired 8 years at the end of this month . I spent 36 years with Caterpillar , Aurora IL in many different jobs . As soon as I retired I started building the layout . Our retirement home has a full basement and that was the plan . Our old house was on a river bank and had no place for a layout with it full of kids and us . So it has been a great thing to keep the brain moving and keep me out of trouble . It is the first layout I have had since 1983 a small one for my son that only lasted about a year before the space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is now retired to so she is coming up with things to do as well . <p> Unsuccessfully tried to retire four times , but people kept offering to pay for my life experience . Finally stuck on the fifth try . Anticipating the next stages after retirement ( downsizing and pushing up daisies ) , adopted webmastering and ecommerce as new hobbies to dispose of trains acquired over many decades in an orderly manner . All the fun of working but on a flexible schedule and embracing various aspects of the model railroading hobby . <p> This June I 'll be retiring after 39 years with Delta Air Lines . I 'll miss flying the 747 to Japan and the Pacific , but I 've got two airplanes of my own to stay in the air . At least I wo n't have to be screened by TSA to fly my own . I started this hobby 40 years ago in 2 rail O Scale . Built a 2 rail layout in our home when we first moved to Florida 24 years ago . Then all the fantastic 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 90 's and my wife was kind enough to surrender the garage where I built a 3 rail layout . So I have two layouts that are pretty much benchwork and track complete and running well , but without much scenery . All these years I think starting the scenery has intimidated me . After retirement I plan to dive in head first and start making mountains , streams , canyons , and towns . I actually have most of the materials I 'll need that have been ordered through the years , just not the courage to get it started . I 'm actually looking forward to starting scenery . <p> I took my wife 's advice and retired in 2014 when I turned 62 .

I sold all my trains in 2015 and am living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have room for a 4 x 8 layout but I am thinking about a 4 X 8 on 2 " thick foam that I can put on kitchen table when I want to play trains and store it up along a wall . <p> I retired at 58 and my last day of work was April 1 , 2016 . Could n't be anymore happier after spending 30.5 years combined with Kraft Foods and Nabisco as a sales rep . The company sure took good care of me while working for them and retiring from Nabisco who split up from Kraft in October 2012 . With the pension and retiree medical , things are good around here . The wife works part-time and my stores that I called on really want to hire part-time . Just not ready to go back to work . I did that full time for 36 years . <p> Keeping very active as I have my own layout here , my club moved to another location last September ( see our topic under the announcements section here ) with much to do there , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ updating . <p> Plenty to do and keeping active and working out daily at my local gym . <p> I retired in 2010 , and I love every minute of it . For the first time , I can keep a regular exercise schedule . And I have two smallish layouts in the basement , one for O scale equipment , the other for Marx/Lionel tinplate . I spent 25 years in the data-processing field , and do n't miss it at all . <p> Basically retired as I work from home ; but still ca n't seem to get much done on the layout . I started a year ago with planning . New England winters are time consuming with snow removal and burning firewood . <p> I " retired " from running the 765 last September 25 . Here 's the video of my final station stop on the CVSR in Akron , Ohio , with my two grandsons aboard . <p> I will " retire " from OGR when we sell the company later this year . <p> However , I 'm still flying for several clients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 350 and owns a home in Key West . I plan to fly for a couple more years , as long as I 'm healthy . In between flights , it 's into the motor home to travel the country in style . 175852 @qwx375852 <p> I retired ten years ago . We stayed in the same place for five more years and I worked a lot of the layout to try to finish it . Almost made it . Moving to Maui was a huge deal . Taking down the layout , packing everything we owned in a Matson container , shipping the car and on and on . I have to admit I worked on the old layout more than I do here . The new layout is twice the size of the old one and I tackled the hardest part first . With taking up diving again , kayaking and Aloha Friday parties almost every week , there is n't enough time . There really no a winter season here so your outside all the time . With the thousands of whales coming now I wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found I go in stages . I 'll work for a couple weeks and then lay off for a few weeks . That seems to be the best way for me . I love the trains and filming underwater . With this place only three blocks away it 's hard to work on the layout . Don <p> I have been dairy farming since 1969 when I finished Cornell . I started taking winters off in 2014 and put a layout in a 20 ' by 30 ' addition . I go back to planting corn and running the forage harvester from April to November . Might go to trains full time after this year . I told my boss to let me know when I create more problems than I solve . 175854 @qwx375854 175853 @qwx375853 <h> Block 175862 @qwx375862 
@@36014841 @5014841/ <h> Whistle Relay Problem and Resolution ! <p> When I activated the whistle in my recently purchased Lionel Classics Fireball Express for the first time , all I heard was a buzzing sound as if the relay coil was energizing , but the armature ( hinged plate ) was not being pulled to the coil . Disassembly required removing four screws to separate the tender shell from the frame . The harder part was to remove an interior red-painted shell/baffle which had the simulated coal load attached with a bolt and screw . This baffle had FIVE crimped tabs which required straightening for removal from the tender frame in order to gain access to the whistle relay . Once carefully removed , I could mechanically close the relay armature and the whistle worked ! So after carefully tracing the wiring and deciding all connections were properly soldered , I then proceeded to examine the relay armature tension and deduced the spring attached had way too much tension and so , on a whim , removed it . Voila , the armature was then attracted to the energized coil and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let the armature drop down by gravity without the unnecessary spring tension . I also carefully adjusted the contact strip on the armature so there was an adequate gap between the contact points . After more testing , I reassembled the tender being careful to twist and NOT bend the baffle tabs so they would be easier to remove in the future . I tossed the aforementioned troublesome spring into my parts cabinet drawer . SUCCESS ! <p> QUESTION : Is it usual to have a spring attached to one of the armature hinges on a whistle relay ? The effect in my case was to have TOO much tension , thereby holding the armature in a DOWN position in spite of the coil energizing ! <p> When Lionel mfg. the " O " GG-1 in the 50 's , an armature spring was so installed . In doing whistle relay rebuilding since the 1960 's , we have always installed an armature spring on every unit , weather horn or whistle relay . We use a ' 027 ' whistle brush spring , bend the ends 90 degree and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off when you let go of the whistle / horn control . I remember my dad discussed this w/ Lionel back in the 1960 's . Harry 175852 @qwx375852 <p> Is the relay actually inverted ( as shown in your exploded view ) in its installation in the GG1 so that gravity would keep the armature closed unless the spring kept it open ? My relay has the armature on the bottom so gravity keeps it normally open until the pulse of DC activates it . <p> Both of my originals are a bit sticky even with a spring . They 've spent a lot of time energized , lol . The spring and pivot gets a wetting of oil every tune up . I cleaned and dressed one of the points once , but they are good relays . 175854 @qwx375854 175853 @qwx375853 <h> Block 175862 @qwx375862 
@@36014843 @5014843/ <h> Sidewalks and Foundations <p> I am opening this thread to see how people approach sidewalks and foundations . I will start by showing how I do them . My way is no doubt neither the right way or the best way . My object is to learn any tips and tricks that people are doing . <p> To start , my layout has no strict era , but as most PostWar kids , I am partial to the steam/diesel transition ( because the Lionel catalogs of my youth were all about the steam/diesel transition , whether intended or not ) . However , modern motive power can be seen on my railroad ( thank you , Norfolk Southern for your Heritage Diesels ! ) . I am a city boy , so industrial and urban America is what I want to create . Specifically , an urban scene capturing the feel of a Bronx commercial neighborhood from the 50-60s is what I am trying to model on the north end of my 6X16 home layout . 175852 @qwx375852 <p> The pictures show my dilemma ..... The sidewalks of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Woodland Scenics buildings and Andre 's Woolworth 's building need sidewalks . Lastly , the Sidewalk foundation of the MTH Jahn 's building is going to look oversized when I add sidewalks to the others unless I do something . <p> My current technique is to roughly measure the area and create cardboard forms that I can resize . Then , I will cut out the foam core board cut , paint and mount it . <p> This is as far as I have gotten : <p> I am looking for comments , suggestions , etc .... if someones technique is superior , I my even go back to square one and try it . <p> Peter- your city is looking good .... for sidewalks I use wooden paint stir sticks ( often free ) . They are approx. 6 scale inches high . I scribe them every inch with a ball point pen , and then paint them with concrete colored paint . John A <p> Peter , I like the technique used by Norm Charbonneau . He used very thin masonite or hard board . I forget the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or break it and then put it back together and you then have joints or cracks . You can round over the edges or chip off a piece for broken curbing . A concrete paint and ink wash and you are in business . <p> Sorry I do not have a picture but I used this technique at the club and I was very satisfied . <p> Your buildings look great . I always use styrene sheets . o40 to , 125 inches thick . They are white . I scribe and sand them and add paint to obtain the color I want . I will sometimes remove or modify existing bases and tie them into the styrene . <p> Your commercial area looks great . It reminded me roughly of the area next to Tom Trains in Ardsley , NY . While I do n't think there was ever a Woolworths in that little area ( if facing Tom 's Trains , the small area of stores to the left and up to the traffic light on Ashford Ave. ) , it looks like a typical downtown square . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When we started our layout we began with several MTH buildings , which have a 1/2 " high base ; nice but way out of scale . Then the Woodland Scenic buildings came out and they had no base . <p> We ended up using 1/2 " MDF to make bases for the Woodland Scenic buildings to bring them in line with the MTH . Then we used 1/4 " MDF to make streets , which butt up against the 1/2 " bases . The resulting 1/4 " " curb " is sill a bit oversized for scale , but not objectionable . <p> Here are two photos . <p> The rear buildings are MTH . There 's a slight difference in the coloring , but not really noticible . <p> Check out Kathy Millatt 's videos on YouTube . She produces concrete sidewalks that are work of art and takes you through it step by step . I 've used wood , styrene and what comes with the kits . It 's a hodge podge .

I painted it gray and then hit it with an India ink / water / alcohol wash . <p> Sorry , my fingers were typing faster than my brain was working . 1/4 " = 1 scale foot . For the overpass I 'm modeling ( with sidewalks ) , I used a base piece of masonite to support the whole thing . A second piece of 1/8 " masonite serves as the road and these 1/4 " thick poplar boards are the sidewalk . See side view below .

I have yet to find a real quality source for rubber stamps and decals .

His prices are more than triple what the late Jim Wilhite was charging - ten bucks for a sheet with everything needed for eight SP steamers . In silver , with logos and cab data . <p> I fully endorse the use of the rubber stamps as offered by JLM Trains , as mentioned in a previous post .

@@36014848 @5014848/ <h> Trains , Trolleys , and Diners : The real story <p> There 's a lot of misinformation out there about diners ( the food establishments ) being made out of old railway cars or trolleys . One area that underscores this confusion is the numerous 0-scale models of " diners " that are converted RR cars . The facts are that " true " diners were buildings constructed as a portable architecture form . Just like railroads , these eateries reflected the designs and fashions of the times . Thus , you find barrel and monitor roofs with clerestories , stainless steel sides , and " modern " streamliners . And , it did n't hurt that some of these manufacturers made rail cars as well as restaurants ( e.g. , Brill , Kullman ? ) . <p> There are always exceptions to every rule and when cities or RRs retired some of their cars , some cooks saw these offerings as an inexpensive way to set up a dining establishment .

However , there is a wall of RR memorabilia visible in the background of the video . <p> **32;88;TOOLONG Again/Streamliner Moderne <p> I 've got some serious weekend errands to devote myself to right now . ( It 's like a 100 degrees in Mass. again and I simply MUST make sorbet before I along with the strawberries wilt ) . Later , hopefully I can scan and post my photos of two Sterling Streamliner-styled diners . The front ends will look VERY familiar to RR fans . One is still in Salem , MA . So fans of Victoria Station , streamliner moderne styling , and diners can have a photo and food field day . <p> Also , I found a great picture of another trolley turned diner turned trolley again and will post the link . Getting back to the original thrust of this post , I now have this observation : while the number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diner-style restaurants is much smaller than the manufacturers of plastic or wood layout models would lead us to believe , the conversion ( encasement ) of some into " diners " has saved at least two for restoration as trolleys . So far , no evidence of a railroad car turned " diner " turned RR car again . Just joking . There 's no need ... unless maybe it was super rare . <p> On the other hand , when real diners burn or are the victims of arson , which they seem to often be when empty and even when active , they either go to the scrap heap or sit rotting in a field somewhere . Sound familiar ? Both hobbies have dedicated preservationists , but sadly , you ca n't save them all . <p> Ace , you have a great sense of history and railroading ( real and model ) , and great pictures to back it up . I loved seeing the track plan . Thanks ! <p> Here are photos of the Sterling Streamliner diners that I have visited . Sterling was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knockoff . The handful of surviving Streamliners apparently have fallen on hard times , including one of these . The side view should be very familiar to RR enthusiasts ! Of course the food fare between the country 's most " moderne " trains and community diners could n't have been more different , but there 's no hiding the fact that the architecture in this case was directly copying the famous engines . <p> Another possible source for the tight coupling/conflation of diner architecture with dining cars and trolleys in the popular mind may be a direct result of how diner owners named their restaurants . In the Sterling Streamliner link below , you 'll see how frequently " Flyer " appears in the title , such as " Yankee Flyer " and " Penn State Flyer " ; and then there was the one named " Dining Car " . Very suggestive of popular regional trains . Perhaps the ' Dining Car ' owner was trying to present an image of the RR dining car , which provided the finest fresh food to set each road apart from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notice also the use of portholes on the center doors . You 'll also see some diner buildings with dual slanted ends -- they look a bit like an MU , do n't they ? : - ) Other diners , including at least one Streamliner knock-off , can be found with " trolley " in their names , too . <p> Lastly , I 'm including two railroad-themed diner photos that are n't Streamliners , along with an especially photogenic " semi-streamliner " . I 'm not aware of any ' semi-streamliner ' design equivalent in the train world but they remind me a bit of Pullman or heavy passenger cars . For the restaurants , the stainless steel was sometimes an add-on over the original enamel siding . <p> Enjoy ! <p> Tomlinson Run Railroad <p> P.S. -- Like RR stock and trolleys , most diners had builder 's plates with a serial number . <p> Examples of Streamliners <p> 1940 Sterling Streamliner #406 , formerly in Salem , NH . Now apparently sitting in a field in CT since 2005 . The slanted side 's windows are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are visible -- along with a classic chevron stripe across the front . 8/27/1994 . <p> 1941 Sterling Streamliner #4110 , Pawtucket , RI . Checkout the slanted end , the windows , and that great paint . This one still has its chevron . Summer 2000 . <p> Examples of RR-influenced Names <p> The Pig ' n Whistle , 1952 Mountain View ( mfr ) . Brighton , MA . It got its name from the stockyards and railroads that were once near by . This one is now closed but still standing . 24 June 2000 . <p> Henry 's Diner , now The Breakfast Club . Worcester #841 , Allston , MA . This one 's a puzzle : from Google satellite there are no obvious former RR tracks nearby , and yet this diner sports a railroad crossing sign topped by a chef 's hat ! Cute by unfathonable to me : - . 175852 @qwx375852 <p> For kicks I 'm researching which former RR cars and trolleys are still functioning as " diners " since I created a list of known ones some years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that one so-called diner consisted of not one but seven RR cars ( per an article ; Google shows five visible ) . Sort of a Victoria Station before there was such a thing . <p> One car was supposed to be FDR 's reelection car and because there was a recent post about FDR 's car 's I thought I 'd post the following link . Scroll past the Chinese food photos to get to the interior shots of the Presidential Car . It 's now part of the " Orient Express " ( nee Andy 's Diner ) in So . Seattle , Washington : <p> On the old diner front we ate at the Cloister Restaurant in Ephrata PA whose modern exterior hides a classic stainless diner from somewhere in the 30 's to the 50 's . They were closing so I could n't see if there was any manufacturing information or " tag " as the diner site on the web calls them . <p> It even has opening windows reminiscent of a passenger car or school bus window . <p> Rule292/Rob , thanks for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on my old list -- maybe because it was n't pretending to be a diner ? The all-knowing , all-seeing interweb has a picture of it when it was The Trolley Stop on Rt . 73 in Skippack , PA . It 's an undisguised trolley . The blog post says it was painted in the colors of the Reading Transit System . <p> Today it is part of the Hotel Fiesole in Skippack and sporting a new look : <p> In continuing my investigation into the historic and present conversion of rail and trolley cars into diner-style restaurants , I found this excellent compilation from the Illinois Railway Museum 's Hicks Car Works blog . There are plenty of photos to enjoy : <p> Some of the information is out-of-date and some links no longer work . However , by combining their data with my own and some serious Googling , I identified about 54 still extant examples across the country -- a number considerably higher than previously recorded by diner historians . The restaurants are roughly divided between repurposed RR cars and trolleys or interurban cars . Regional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found in states without nearby diner manufacturers . Of course , that observation needs to be balanced by how many true diners where in the region , the era , the economy , and etc . <p> Because this is a miscellaneous *photo* post , I hope to get some pics up soon . Initial impressions of the many photos out there suggest that there was a strong connection made between rail and restaurant : rail/city transportation designs inspired small restaurants and restauranteurs actively choose to interpret and market their buildings by making that connection . <p> A final note : true restaurant diner architecture evolved from horse-drawn lunch wagons . The restaurant was set up on a small plot of unused land and then removed at night to avoid town ordinances . My research revealed that around 2013 , several road-rated trolley cars were converted into mobile eateries . No doubt this was part of the still ongoing explosion of popular celebrity-chef style food trucks . Thus , the design and function has come full circle as these eateries are once again mobile and parked on unused plots of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in just these three years , most trolley restaurants seem to have folded . Of course , being mobile , they could have moved on ... : - ) . <p> My hope is make a state-by-state list available so that any of you with an interest in this design intersection can take your cameras and your empty stomachs to find examples near you . By adding photos to share here and through your patronage , we have two great ways to help preserve these bits of history . <p> One more note to add : apparently restaurants claiming to have an FDR car are as common as inns claiming a visit by George Washington . The story behind the car and link in my August 16 post has been challenged by several bloggers . Regardless , it is still a beautifully crafted interior , which has survived . <p> There was a Victoria Station in Southfield , Michigan ( a suburb of Detroit ) and it was one of our favorite places . But I guess others did n't think so , and now it 's gone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Henry Ford museum in Dearborn has a restored one inside called Lamy 's , originally from Massachusetts . Serves 50s style fare as part of an experience . Never was a railroad car , but the style resembles it . 175852 @qwx375852 <p> Jerry , great to read that Lamy 's is serving food again . Massachusetts 's loss is Michigan 's gain . The diner was built in 1946 and is a semi-streamliner Worcester Lunch Car model just like the Rosebud pictured in my post . So , absolutely , there 's a railroad influence there . Do I remember correctly that the museum also has an original ( or reproduction ? ) lunch wagon of the type that eventually gave rise to the architectural form ? <p> This evening I just stumbled on yet another interurban car turned diner turned ... well it 's waiting to be restored back to an interurban car by the Seashore Trolley Museum in Kennebunkport , Maine . I 'm not sure if some of the photos of the trolley and its diner incarnation are copyrighted , so I 'll just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1902 by Wason Manufacturing Co. as a very high-end electric parlor car . Wason was a J. G. Brill subsidiary , which along with the parent company , also built restaurant diner buildings . Around 1932 ? , the car was sold for $300 and became the Berkshire Hills Diner in Pittsfield , MA . The diner became part of a larger restaurant that had a fire in 1994 . This event paved the way for the car 's shell to be donated to the Trolley Museum , where it is currently in storage . <p> Surprises : some 50's-ish diner buildings had rounded ends with curved glass windows at the building 's " corners " . This is something that would seem impractical in a rail car , interurban , or trolley because of the way cars were connected and or people would enter and exit the cars . But apparently the Berkshire Hills had some curved glass windows . From the pictures it looks like it might have been on the car ends . <p> Speaking of J. G. Brill , here is a Brill-manufactured diner from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 323 Main Street , Wakefield , South Kingston , RI . A quick Google check shows that it looks even less like a trolley-inspired building now than it did when I took this photo : <p> In 2000 it was the Kiddie Closet . Now it 's the " velvet sic Revolution : wardrobe revival " . <p> UPDATE : Here 's the side view for more of that Brill trolley feel : 175852 @qwx375852 <p> This post started out by talking about companies that manufactured " real " diner buildings , and the fact that instead some people used decomissioned railroad , interurban , or trolley cars as the basis for their restaurant buildings . And they often played up a train or transportation connection in architectural touches or in the restaurant 's name . Some people even built their own buildings from scratch . Even then , the draw to mimic aspects from American transportation was strong . Here 's a diner I visited today that has it all ! It morphed from a home-made double-ended streamliner train-style diner to a trolley . Now that 's progress ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roland L. Stickney . Apparently , he was an automobile designer . Here 's the patent via patent-room.com . Notice that is shows port-hole windows and not the slits that the streamliner diners ended up with ( see prior posts ) . The porthole shape ties in " moderne " ocean liners as well , and we know that portholes sometimes appeared in railroad stock and on plenty of Lionel cabooses : <p> From 1945 to 1950 , Donald Evans -- a Salisbury , Massachusetts man -- built a rare double-ended streamliner himself . The chrome center door that he used came from an earlier diner built by the Worcester Lunch Car Co. and owned by his brother . Perhaps by the time he finished in 1950 , the moderne design craze had started to move on to the chrome craze ? Regardless , it was called Evans ' Streamliner , suggesting that the look and appeal continued a bit longer . Here 's a black and white print of a John Baeder painting after the diner was moved to Lowell to its current location and renamed ( from an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and moved in 1956 : <p> Click here to see its red phase and read the restaurant 's history ( scroll down about mid-page for Gorham Street Diner ) . This post contains photos of its amazing transformation in 1981 from a double-ended streamliner to a ... trolley car ! ( It does n't get much better than this . ) <p> So , had the lore of the train faded from memory while the trolley image surged ahead ? Was a trolley more familiar to the city dwellers of Lowell ? Here is the Trolley Stop in 1991 ( my photo ) . Notice the railroad bridge on the right that says " Welcome to Prince Spaghettiville " : <p> And here 's the diner as it looks today . Just as I pulled up , the MBTA ( Boston ) Commuter Rail went by . It would have made a great shot had I not been driving : <p> With all the hoopla on the side about " Lowell 's Historic " ... you 'd think that this building was an actual trolley car but we know better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in red -- one with Rock Island and Maine Central boxcars visible on the four-track girder bridge . There 's also a nice photograph of a U.S. Mail trolley from I believe the Boston area . In the full shot from today , if you look closely at the entrance windows , you can see fake etched glass . All in all , it 's very nicely done and a pleasant place to visit . The windows were amazingly clean and I would have loved to have taken a photograph from a window in the " trolley " entrance of a train going by . But that would have been a long wait ( Saturday PM schedule ) . <p> For those of you who missed seeing rivets and real converted RR/interurban/trolleys , here 's an " art shot " of the girder bridge : <p> Question to ponder : Why do you think trolleys as an image for food establishments are so popular ? When the railroad declined and buses and autos ascended , were trolleys somehow seen as something in between ? Is it easier for later generations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city buses or are used to move tourists about ? <p> Tomlinson Run Railroad 175852 @qwx375852 <p> While on vacation this week , I had hoped to photograph and eat at Sisson 's Diner , a 1926 Wason trolley , which has been a restaurant in Middleboro , MA for years . However , driving any where near Cape Cod on Labor Day weekend seemed foolhardy . So I improvised : I ate at a real diner and then went in search of what I thought was a static trolley car display a few blocks away at Lowell , MA 's Boott Mill . It was a lucky day ; I got two cars that it turns out actually run in this city , and an antique diner to " Boott " . <p> Featured are : the Cameo Diner ( builder unknown ) ; a 1924 New Orleans Perley-Thomas-built trolley ; an accurate reproduction open air trolley ; and the 1930s Paradise Diner ( Worcester Lunch Car Co . ) .

Yes , I 'm originally from Pittsburgh . There 's lots of modeling inspiration to be found in Pittsburgh and surrounding locales and , fortunately , lots of available models . The Boston area is n't too shabby either : - ) . <p> Thanks , Suzukovich . I 'm hoping that others will be inspired to post some railcar-trolley pix or share their favorite RR-inspired restaurants/diners even if they are n't 100% on topic .

Mr. Lamy ( a WWII vet ) opened the diner in 1946 in Marlborough , MA , Moved to Framingham , MA shortly after , then moved to Hudson , MA in 1947 , then sold the diner in 1949 . <p> I work in Greenfield Village , part of the Henry Ford , and drive the Model Ts there . Lamy 's is in the Museum part , but I drive by the Owl Night Lunch wagon every day at least 4 dozen times !

I saw it on a you tube video a while ago and thought the whole layout was great capturing varios industries , but I was especially impressed that he tackled an incline . <p> Also , within the last week on this Forum , someone posted a picture of their father 's cog incline that they just got set up to run on an angled board . You might have luck seaching for it as it was very recent . Now there 's an entirely different kind of " third-rail " : - ) . <p> I saw the cog RR pictures , it was on My Father 's Cool Toys .

Pictures would be greatly appreciated . <p> Thanks , <p> Mike , <p> Some advice from the point of view of having looked everywhere for dining car staff , including chefs/cooks : <p> 1 . The interiors of Lionel and MTH passenger cars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even smaller . Also , Lionel 's cars ' floors ride high over the trucks and so if you use true O scale figures , whether seated or standing , they will not necessarily be visible in the car windows assuming that they fit at all . Thus , you need to stick to smaller figures . All of the K-Line , Lionel and MTH Railking figures I mention below are smaller than true O scale . <p> 2 . K-Line produced some dining car staff , I think no more than four porters . As you asked for photos here 's a set of three of these figures in my ( as yet unfinished ) Lionel 21 " aluminum Texas Special StationSounds diner , which is populated mostly by the car 's original figures , MTH Railking figures and others I scavenged from other cars . The three porters are one each ringing a dinner chime , taking an order and serving up a meal : <p> K-Line also made one bar porter , who is shown below in another car , which is the observation car of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on K-Line tooling ) : <p> Do n't worry , I straightened out the drink in his hand before the car was completed . <p> 3 . There are still some of the K-Line figure sets around that come up on *Bay from time to time . Incidentally , the Lionel 6-83653 seated passenger figure set for their new 21 " ABS cars is a re-release of the K-Line passenger figures WITHOUT the standing car staff figures . Aside from these , there 's an MTH Railking set of diner figures but it does not include staff . There 's a vendor at York called Scenic Express ( they have a website ) that has a vast array of figures in every scale . Trouble is , you have to see the figures labelled O or S scale to decide if they will actually fit in the space you have for them . Another online source is Peoplescale.com who catalog figures by height . At 1.5 inches high their O figures are too tall but they offer smaller figures ( starting at 1 " height ) as well and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chef . <p> 4 . Ready-made chefs/cooks - I have not found any in either S or O scale although I know Arttista produced one a while back . But if you are adding figures to a Lionel/MTH diner the kitchen space is so small that it 's feasible to use HO figures in there bearing in mind that to be seen through the kitchen windows they 'll have to be small anyway . Preiser makes this set of merry chefs , complete with pots and pans : <p> 5 . Finally , dollhouse " quarter scale " figures , which are essentially O , are widely available but so far I have not tracked down a chef . I keep checking Shapeways 3D printing to see if someone comes up with something but so far no luck . <p> while there look around for more interior details such as ash tray stands , seats , lamps , headrest covers and more ! <p> Thanks for making them . How about adding some chefs and waiters to the product line ? No one else makes them and it looks like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your replies . <p> Hancock52 , those are some nice interiors . Where did you get the carpet runner that goes down the center of the diner ? I am going to paint my floor dark red to look like carpet . The runner makes it look a lot better . <p> There is a chef and waiter available from Omen Miniatures , a British outfit . They are metal , high quality and 1/43 scale . I assume trimming would work , although they 're about $6-$8 each for unpainted figures . Stocky chef , tall hat - why not ? <p> Hancock52 , those are some nice interiors . Where did you get the carpet runner that goes down the center of the diner ? I am going to paint my floor dark red to look like carpet .

I may try to create the runner , but I think I will use cardstock instead of fabric . How did you print on fabric ? <p> There is paper-backed fabric you can get for inkjet printing - I think what I used is made by Avery and is a craft item . The backing helps transfer the fabric through the printer . Maybe just as important , the backing stops the fabric from coming apart at the edges when you cut it . <p> I used fabric because I wanted some texture mainly because in Lionel cars the floor is very visible through car windows because it is not far below their level . But in fact printable card stock will work as would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set 65355 of Railroad Personnel that includes a waiter/server that is included with a conductor , engineer and two other figures . The set is 1/43 and I cut the feet off the waiter to lower his height inside the dining car . I have glued his shoes and ankles back on after cutting 1/4 " off the bottom of the apron . This is the only dining car figure in O-scale that I have found . <p> Yes , the Arttista cook is dressed for an outdoor barbeque but he can be easily repainted for full chef whites or those checked chef pants via a suitable grey wash . I was at the Amherst Railway Society show in W. Springfield yesterday and meant to get a second figure but was rushed ( i.e. , late ) and forgot . <p> My plan is to cut off the sides of the spatula that the figure holds and shape it into a large carving knife , then repose the arm ( if possible ) for counter top work . Perhaps take a Dremel tool to his large belly , too ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car , I 'll have two chefs who wo n't look like twins . <p> I 'm also considering some of Arttista 's grocer and similar shop figures . They have aprons on and perhaps can be repainted to good effect . Another figure manufacturer whose name escapes me offers a camp cook , but unfortunately he holds a huge horn in front of his face .

I have yet to take the top off to see how many chefs I can put in the kitchen but I 'm hoping for two . The lack of space makes measuring and then placing a rug challenging in the dining section . I 'm considering using my Dremel tool to remove the tables and create four-legged ones like you have . But that 's a BIG step for me and I 'm not ready to take it yet . <p> So , in the meantime , I 've been collecting security envelopes whose inside prints resemble floor coverings or wall coverings .

I found a plastic grape tomato or similar plastic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If I can get more , I 'm considering using it for an etched glass window in a trolley . By flipping it over so the design is flat , I hope it can be used to mimic etching on a double glass partition in my fantasy diner . I 'm also considering hand " etching " my own images in clear plastic . <p> Could you print out those murals you found and touch them up with pastels for color ? Or perhaps use the airbrush tool in a drawing program ? It might give it a spritz of color like those hand colored postcards , which might work for O scale and the door wall location . <p> Getting back to the original post , in addition to multiple chefs working in a cramped kitchen , and the wait staff , a dining car steward was a very key figure . The man in the white coat at the end of the car was in charge of the raw food ordering , taking payment from the diners , making sure they were comfortable , and much more . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ) a man in a white jacket to great effect . But I see that you already have HM the Queen serving in that capacity , no doubt royally . <p> I hope that this is not deviating too far off topic but to try to stick with it to start : <p> 1 . I think that probably all the available resources for dining car staff have been identified in this thread ; they include all the ones I 've tracked down , here , in the UK or indeed from German or far eastern sources . There are not many in O or S scales whereas there are enough in HO to satisfy most modeller 's ambitions . I am going to experiment with the HO Preiser figures in my Texas Special dining car kitchen as the windows of it are small to the point that larger figures could not be seen through them properly anyway ( the windows in question are the second to fourth from right in the image below ) : <p> 2 . I agree that the steward you mention was a key @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bill as it were . The old K-Line figures were really the best and as Lionel have by some means access to the seated passenger figures of the same production era I imagine that the molds for the dining car staff still exist somewhere . The best hope may be 3D printing if anyone has the initiative to produce the necessary drawings . <p> 3 . I did not think of coloring up the murals I found in various books ( mainly The Official Pullman-Standard Library , vol. 7 on the western railways ) but it 's a good idea and I might try that when I next resume work on my project . <p> 4 . Lastly , I really can not compete with your earlier thread you linked to but since you mention QE II 's presence in the dining car , that was just a piece of tomfoolery/whimsy on my part after I found her figurine at the Scenic Express booth at York . She 's not in fact my favorite figure in these two cars ; this Texan party girl is : <p> I actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table but she slipped into the posture you see and there she 's stayed . The steward on the left is one of the best of the K-Line figures . <p> P.S. If you look around on this forum there are some interesting dining car interior threads posted by people who 've done some really intricate detailing . 175852 @qwx375852 <p> Yes , I have stumbled on some of the fabulous dining car interior posts by other forum members . Really phenomenal ! <p> Ah , the " Texan party girl " . There 's one in every car ! It looks like she 's quite enchanted with a fish in a fish bowl ? Both of them are " into the ' drink ' " , so to speak . I have a sloppy drunk Arttista figure that I am planning on having staggering up the diner aisle while the roller skating waitress is approaching in the opposite direction with her full tray . A fun time will be had by all . That 's the plan anyway ; I 've yet to get the top off the dining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very nice K-Line figure for the steward , and I love those great placemats . Thanks for the extra pix . It shows what 's possible . <p> Hancock52 , Your interiors are great . I am not going to that extent with mine , but yours are very inspiring and have some great features that I may consider in mine . <p> The set I am starting with is a set of six MTH RailKing O-27 cars . This will be the first set that gets interior detailing and is my trial run . I have 21 MTH Premier cars , 13 Williams 70 ' cars and 12 scale heavyweights that will get passengers in the future when I have time to allocate to those projects . <p> I e-mailed Nigel Smith of Omen miniatures about their chef and waiter figures . It 's been a couple of days and I have n't heard back yet . If I am able to get them , I will post some pics of them with my K-Line figures for a comparison for those that are interested . <p> We 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MTH cars . You 've got quite a collection to work with . By the way , I keep getting a " bandwidth exceeded message " on the retailer 's side when I try the Omen miniatures link that Firewood provided . <p> For those interested in seeing their chef and other figures , here 's a different retailer : <p> Not to belabor this ( hey it is one of my favorite topics ) . But I recently stumbled on a " Pullman " steward and a waitress by Phoenix Figures in the UK -- they may be a little large at 1/43 scale . I like the steward , although he lacks the nice menu of the example in a prior post . The waitress looks better suited for a Harvey House or British pub than a dining car , but she holds a tray that might come in handy . The website links and item numbers are visible in the photos ; the main page is : www.sanddmodels.co.uk <p> Hancock 52 , I really like your work . What a great idea to print on real fabric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ texture is a great touch ( no pun intended ) . The observation car gives you so much space to work with and be creative . Nicely done . I especially like the clear " glass " at the ends , and have set aside some clear plastic for a modification that I 'm planning for my PRR diner . Did you add that or was it part of the original model ? <p> The glass partition was added - it 's not in the original model . The intention was to produce a representation of the kind of etched glass partition that was in Pullman-built streamliners of the period , including the Texas Special .

@@36014850 @5014850/ <p> On Sunday March 12 my wife and I took Amtrak 's new Winter Park Express out of Denver for a day of skiing . The 2 hour train ride far exceeded our expatiations " first rate for convenience , friendliness , and especially the scenery along the route . UP 's ( former D&amp;RGW ) curving 2% climb up the Front Range passes through 29 tunnels and several horseshoe curves before entering 6.2 mile Moffat tunnel under the Continental Divide . The views from our high level coach were ever changing and spectacular at times ( IMO the equal of those from the Silverton train ) . As we entered Moffat Tunnel the car host ( 1 per car " 8 cars ) advised us to put on our ski boots so we would be ready to go when the train stopped . The Winter Park station is virtually at the west portal of Moffat tunnel , and has recently been upgraded with snow free heated platforms . After leaving our coach we walked to the middle of the train where the Amtrak crew handed us our skis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cars . The train stops only several hundred yards from the lifts and base facilities . Skiers with previously purchased lift tickets were on the slopes within minutes of leaving the train . Our car hosts were enthusiastic local skiers who were ready to offer advice and assistance . One benefit of their job was that they got to ski while the train waited several miles down the line for the afternoon return trip . <p> While Winter Park does n't have the ski acreage and amenities that the big name Colorado ski resorts have , it is family friendly , slightly lower cost , and has lots of interesting trails . The big advantage of taking the Winter Park Express is that you can relax and enjoy the scenery coming and going to the slopes , while others fight heavy weekend traffic on I70 . In 2017 the Winter Park Express will run weekends from January 7 through March 26 . For non-skiers I 'd recommend the ride just for the scenery . <p> Below are several photos we took at the Denver and Winter Park stations . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles below Moffat Tunnel we were surprised to see 12 wrecked empty covered hoppers lying on a steep slope along the tracks . Over the loudspeaker in our coach we were told that 2 days before our trip several cars in the middle of a very long eastbound ( downgrade ) freight derailed on the sharp curve . From the vantage point of our train the area appeared very remote with no immediate road access . A short distance up the line we saw a large assortment of heavy off- rail wrecking equipment staged in an open area . We were told that heavy special purpose dozers were used to push several of the derailed cars clear of the right of way in order to re-open the line as soon as possible " however not in time for Saturday 's 7 AM Winter Park Express . Amtrak cancelled the train and attempted to contact the estimated 500 hundred passengers by phone in time to avoid a fruitless trip Union Station . Later that day the route was re-opened allowing the east and westbound California Zephyrs to pass the site . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and by the time our Sunday morning Winter Park Express passed the site no slow orders were in effect . The official word on the cause of the wreck is not out , but our Amtrak crew speculated that it might be related to braking issues . Hopefully I 'll learn more about the cause of the derailment in the Trains Newsletter . Given the terrain , it also would be interesting to learn how the UP goes about retrieving the 12 cars . <p> Below are several photos of the train and derailed cars we took with our I-phones . <p> Ed Rappe PRRT&amp;HS 421 175852 @qwx375852 <p> Thanks for the pictures - looks great . It was really good news when , after several years of negotiations and logistical arrangements , it was announced last year that the ski train would be running again . It 's especially timely given the crowded weekend traffic on I-70 these days . It appears they 've done a first class job on the train and the logistics , and the popularity of the train reflects this . <p> My wife and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lived in Denver . In those days , it was still operated by the Rio Grande , of course . Our train was pulled by F-7s with heavyweight passenger cars . I have a poster in my train room to remember it by . ( Photo was taken in March 1984 ) 175852 @qwx375852 <p> We lived in Grand Lake , west entrance to Rocky Mountain National Park , for a few years . At the time our daughter was just starting 1st grade and had to travel down to Granby for school , just north of Winter Park . The really cool part about her going to school in that area was that during the first month of ski season the entire school would go to the ski slopes one day a week as part of their P.E . program . After the first month the program continued on a voluntary basis on Saturdays , all the kids needed to bring was their lunch . The BetterHalf and I did n't take up skiing til some years later when we moved to Cali. 175854 @qwx375854 175853 @qwx375853 <h> Block 175862 @qwx375862 
@@36014851 @5014851/ <h> Beware of the US Post Office package acceptance of FedEx and UPS Packages . <p> A couple of years back the US Post office started a new service in which they would accept UPS and FedEx packages using your P.O. Box . I was thrilled because I would n't have to worry about my trains sitting on my porch waiting for me to come home or for someone to steal them . It has worked fine until yesterday . FedEx delivered two packages for me to my local post office . The post office signed for them ... however the post office has lost the packages before they got to me . They think they may have given them to the wrong box holder . They are also telling me that they are not responsible because it was n't sent via US Mail . FedEx says the package was delivered and signed for . SO I am basically being told your out of luck . I hope you are not out a lot of money . <p> So what looked like a great safe way to get your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even if we signed for it " . Any suggestions on what should be done next . <p> there is the bailor/bailee argument that I distantly recall from law school and it being on a bar exam . The post office in accepting the package acted as the bailee . I think ! As a bailee you take on responsibilities to the bailor . . . you . <p> USPS lost a package of mine about a month ago . The clerk gave me the postmaster 's phone number as she was not in at the moment . The post mistress was most helpful , and asked for a phone number she would call , if the search turned up nothing . It took 3 weeks , but I did get my package , which was lost within the P.O. <p> Of course this was a straight USPS shipment , no UPS/FEDEX . But I 'd say to talk to the postmaster of your local P.O. Take it above the counter clerks . <p> Well , I jumped on this service , as my P.O. had given me good service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their budget constraints ) . I had a problem with FEDEX refusing to deliver to the post office ( per a shipper 's statement ) . ( Maybe that is due to this kind of occurrence ) I also had a problem with shipping labels of shippers , maybe standardized by UPS , that did not allow for all the information required by the post office . You have to DRILL this into some shippers . The second time I used this service , the package sat in general delivery for over a week , until one of the counter people recognized my name . The not so swift shipper did not include all required info in the address . I think you need to query the shipper as to how he <p> addressed your package ... you may not get it back , but you will know why it was in <p> general delivery ( I am assuming you have a P.O. Box ) . 175855 @qwx375855 <p> If you have a PO Box you first have to sign ip for them to accept the packages . Then you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the number , as if it were an apartment number or a suite number . Not that I would recommend this service now.Scott Smith <p> And do you know that when you send something postal service overnight , or even priority mail , that once it leaves the building a PRIVATE carrier has it and NOT the US postal system ? That 's why things do n't often get there when they say it will . <p> If you paid for the items using a credit card you might be able to recover the value of the loss with the help of the credit card company . Depending on the credit card company , losses like that might be covered . <p> Blessed is The Man that trusts in the LORD , whose hope is in Him . For he shall be as a tree planted by the waters and never fails to bear fruit . <p> If you paid for the items using a credit card you might be able to recover the value of the loss with the help of the credit card company . Depending on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covered . <p> One of the VERY BIG reasons I prefer to shop with my American Express card , as I 've noted frequently in the past ! In the very few times I 've needed their customer service for something , they came through in superb fashion , and quickly . <p> I imagine other cards also offer a similar service ( not sure who , or how responsive they may be ) , but I have been very happy with the way AMEX has resolved any issues I may have had . <p> UPS has never shipped to PO boxes . Only real , physical addresses . UPS does deliver pkgs to Post offices to be delivered by them to actual addresses , not the PO boxes . I do n't know about Fedex but I would think not <p> The post office is a another poorly run government operation where the " majority " of people there do n't want to work , or do n't care and are overpaid . <p> My local mail carrier has spun the tires on the mail jeep from box to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that has n't been my experience at all . I 've had excellent luck with well over a thousand USPS Priority Mail shipments made over the years , and generally good service from PO employees . Some have had an attitude issue , but I find those people employed everywhere . Spinning tires ? - our home mail carriers are all very nice , and I have never observed anything but careful driving by postal employees . They drive more carefully than I do , that 's for sure . <p> USPS lost a registered mail package of mine . When I pressed the Postmaster of the state I got a ' oh well .... happens ' . Being registered it was insured but I lost an item I have yet been able to replace . So ' registered signature required ' does not mean too much . <p> UPS has never shipped to PO boxes . Only real , physical addresses . UPS does deliver pkgs to Post offices to be delivered by them to actual addresses , not the PO boxes . I do n't know about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before , when using the post office you use the physical address of the post office with your box number for instance here is my P.O. Box address for FedEx and UPS ; <p> D. Scott Smith <p> 6621 Williamson Road <p> #19562 <p> Roanoke , VA 24019 <p> Vs . <p> D. Scott Smith <p> P.O. Box 19562 <p> Roanoke , VA 24019 <p> I have received packages from UPS and FedEx . I have received FedEx packages from MTH and Nassau Hobby using the first address I listed . The manager of the post office told me that they had 500 UPS packages delivered this week for people 's P.O.Boxes . If you have a P.O. Box you have to sign a form to give the post office permission to accept your packages from FedEx and UPS . <p> If I am going to receive a package ( UPS , FedEX , or whatever ) and know that I will not be at my home to receive it , I will pay the local UPS Store a small fee and have the package shipped to them for them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been received so i can pick it up . <p> If I am going to receive a package ( UPS , FedEX , or whatever ) and know that I will not be at my home to receive it , I will pay the local UPS Store a small fee and have the package shipped to them for them to hold it . They will call me when its been received so i can pick it up . <p> Exactly , except , I have never had to pay UPS for me to pick up a package at the distribution terminal . <p> I do n't know why Scott did n't think of this before . The UPS terminal ca n't be very much farther away from Scott than the post office . If you do n't want stuff on your doorstep for the wife to see just pick it up at UPS . I 've never had a problem when I did that . <p> UPS is actually closer than the post office . However Roanoke County requires that I have a P.O.Box since I have a business I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advantage of the service that the post office offers ? Of course I now have an answer to that question <p> One of the VERY BIG reasons I prefer to shop with my American Express card , as I 've noted frequently in the past ! In the very few times I 've needed their customer service for something , they came through in superb fashion , and quickly . <p> I imagine other cards also offer a similar service ( not sure who , or how responsive they may be ) , but I have been very happy with the way AMEX has resolved any issues I may have had . <p> I agree about AMEX , do n't understand why people complain about using American Express . Looking up the fees they charge are compatible with Visa/MasterCard ( to the vendor ) . <p> I had placed an order with Sears for two 2 ton bottle jacks . UPS delivers a package to my front door , the box is empty . You can clearly see the shipping weight of the box on the label ( 36 LBS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the doorstep ( the seams of the box had slit ) . <p> I call Sears and UPS , I get the usual statement to save the box in case they like to see it . A couple of weeks go by and I hear nothing from Sears , I had called three times questioning the status of my reimbursement or re-delivery of the items . Each time I called , had to explain over and over what had happened . <p> So seeing that I was getting nowhere with Sears , I call AMEX , Bam-problem solved . They credit the account , they fight with Sears , not me . <p> I have tried this with Visa and M/C , I get a runaround about online orders . <p> Unfortunately one of the missing packages contained 5 laptop batteries . According to American Express insurance policy they do not cover any batteries . But they will expect me to pay for those on my statement when the bill comes in . <p> UPS , FedEx and DHL all have a service linked to the USPS . FedEx calls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last package I got via this service traveled 1000 's miles extra to get to me ..... and many extra days too . <p> Also I only have a PO Box as until about a month ago we had no physical address ..... and only do now because of Homeland Security . I was ' only yellow house on the right ' for many years ! <p> But all 3 package services do deliver to PO Boxes if not direct then through a partnership with the USPS . In a county with 99% of the addresses are POB .... it happens a lot . <p> I 've had items shipped by both UPS and FedEx that have come to the post office to be delivered by them . I think FedEx calls it SmartPost . I do n't recall if UPS has a name for it , but recently I had ordered several lawnmower parts from Sears , some that came to the house via UPS and some that came via UPS to be delivered by USPS ( first time , never before ) that I had to pick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ address mail delivery since I have a POB . If I do n't include the box number in the my physical delivery address and the person at the post office is n't aware that I have a POB , that item may get shipped or mailed back . When completing an order delivery address online , I include the POB number in the second address line of the shipping address but a lot of times when the item comes the POB number will have been dropped . One of the clerks at the post office told me recently to just include the number with no mention of POB . Hopefully the shipper will include the number . It 's frustrating because a lot of the time you have no idea what carrier they will use or what type of shipping the carrier will be using . One would assume that if they used either FedEx or UPS and you gave them your physical delivery address , such as your home , they would actually deliver it to your home . Now you do n't have a clue . <p> There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bash the USPS , FED EX , and UPS when something goes wrong with your package delivery . I had my share of disappointments with all three . I work for the USPS and I 'll wo n't be the first or the last to criticize them for sloppy work and for hiring some lazy people , but this has nothing to do with being a government agency , it people 's work attitude and you find it wherever people work . My neighbor works for UPS and he all ways complaining about some of his co-workers " lazy-*** " attitudes . Until any of you work in any of these delivery companies and learn how your mail and packages are sorted , please hold your inexperienced thoughts . I guess I should be expecting some hate responses from some people . All of these companies have amazing and complexed computer and sorting systems , they all also have for the majority , knowledgeable and conscientious employees who want to serve the public , there always a bad apple in the bunch . It is unfortunate to us when we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ package . Scott needs to request an inquiry from the Postmaster and hope that if the package was placed into another PO box that the person who has it will return it to Post Office . <p> There is one other possibility , his wife became curious about all the new trains showing up on his train layout and discovered that they were showing up at his PO box . She has intercepted this package and it is now buried in his front lawn . <p> I 've had items shipped by both UPS and FedEx that have come to the post office to be delivered by them . I think FedEx calls it SmartPost . I do n't recall if UPS has a name for it , <p> With UPS , it is called " the last mile " . But they really do n't want you to know that the USPS is delivering you package for them . They mostly use this service in low volume areas and since the USPS is delivering mail in these areas anyway and every day except Sunday , it made economic sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> All the delivery folks ( USPS , UPS , ect ) seem to enjoy leaving packages in the rain or snow , on the open front steps , 15 feet from the street , in plain sight from a block away . Thus the work address deliveries . <p> Right now I have an insurance claim in on UPS , Driver left the insured package ( a pair of the Presidential cars ( unnamed on package ) ) on my brothers steps in Phoenix , Az . They disappeared . <p> UPS has never shipped to PO boxes . Only real , physical addresses . UPS does deliver pkgs to Post offices to be delivered by them to actual addresses , not the PO boxes . I do n't know about Fedex but I would think not <p> Certainly instills much confidence in the USPS - or it confirms they are spiraling out of control into the toilet . <p> I would suggest as others have that you speak with ( in person ) the Postmaster . <p> If that seems to not be going well , mention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that no one else has this problem ( the subtle threat - you have other choices for shipping and so do we on the forum ) . <p> The moral of the story - avoid using the USPS at all costs . It is an incredibly dysfunctional organization that is technically bankrupt , is and has been mismanaged for years , has a staff that has been beaten down and demoralized . Not the ideal organization to be handling your goods . <p> Again , sorry this happened , but for a USPS employee to say - in effect - " not my problem , yours " is the height of ignorance . They have a fiduciary responsibility to convey the package to the correct recipient . Anything short of that is a breach of contract . <p> With UPS , it is called " the last mile " . But they really do n't want you to know that the USPS is delivering you package for them . They mostly use this service in low volume areas and since the USPS is delivering mail in these areas anyway and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand off the package to USPS for final delivery . <p> Two things ....... <p> USPS gives great service for the price 99% of the time . It 's that 1% that is always a critical item tha hurts ! Back in my ebay days I only shipped USPS ..... and had good results . We live in the most rural area east of the Mississippi so that 's one reason we see more of the USPS working with UPS , FedEx and DHL here . <p> The USPS issues have more to do with upper management than front line workers . My Post Office is a one person office . She reports to THREE people . That will not work for long before it collapses on itself . <p> UPS and FedEx both have services that allow you to hold at their facility for free . ( Free to sign up as well ) UPS is called UPS My Choice and FedEx is Delivery Manager . For expensive items I always make sure I get tracking numbers and then log in and change the delivery to hold at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the delivery address to one of their stores ( for a small fee ) . I 'm not sure about FedEx . <p> There are a lot you out there that just like to bash the USPS , FED EX , and UPS when something goes wrong with your package delivery . <p> You are so very right about that ! Every thread like this ultimately turns into a bash of EVERY delivery service , be it USPS , UPS , FedEx , or some other delivery agent . Turns out to be a wash each and every time . <p> The truth of the matter is that all of these agencies do a fine job most of the time , but there is no service that is 100% error free . <p> One of the things that really surprised me when we got the house in the US was UPS , FedEx etc . Leaving the packages outside the door . <p> There is just no way they will do this in the UK . I mean NO WAY even if you ask them to . <p> If your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to arrange redelivery and <p> details of the depot if you want to pick it up . <p> Parcel Force ( the privatised package arm of Royal Mail ) which delivers the larger packages sent via USPS to the UK . Will leave packages at your local Post Office but they are the only ones to do so . They may in some cases leave a package with a neighbour . <p> Of the few legal classes I took , the best thing I learned is just because they say they are not responsible does not mean they are not . They offered this service , you accepted and they did not perform as advertised . They signed for the package and accepted it on your behalf and then claim to have lost it . Regardless of what they say a court may see it differently and force them to compensate you . I agree with others who said to talk to the Postmaster and try and get relief . Otherwise small claims court may be the place to take it ( not sure on which court but you get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawyer for this but I 'm sure the lawyers on here may disagree with that Point is , never give up just because they say they are not responsible . BigRail <p> For UPS you can also change the delivery address to one of their stores ( for a small fee ) . I 'm not sure about FedEx . <p> FedEx will also deliver to the nearest store at no charge . On expensive items , I request a signature delivery and if I am unavailable I have it held at the store . For USPS if you request a signature they will not deliver without a signature and the package will go to your local post office . <p> All in all it amazes me that these companies handle a gazillion packages per day and unlike the airline 's luggage problem , I rarely hear/read about difficulties with lost packages . <p> The heart of the matter is ALL carriers have problems when the workload involves billions of items and ALL delivery persons make mistakes , it 's just the nature of the beast . The only solution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a local store and we all know that 's not going to happen . <p> My business experience with UPS , Ups Freight and Fed-Ex over the last 30 years and their performance has been far greater in comparison than any train manufacturer , broker , or LHS by 100% and that is based on thousands plus vs hundreds of actual interactions . Fed-Ex once returned exactly to the day , a package that was shipped to Finland on 9-11 . Ups has misplaced but never actually permanently " lost " anything . I had a few incidents out of hundreds of Ebay purchases where the UPS online tracking said the package was delivered and was not . Some were delivered and the site said they were not . The counter people always said the Web site was always " wrong " . After a few calls to the local Postmaster who personally found a couple .

@@36014852 @5014852/ <h> Old Driver Identification and New Locomotive <p> Hello everyone I have a new addition to my locomotive collection , I bought a MTH 3460 Class 4-6-4 Santa Fe Hudson , which happens to be one of my favorite locomotives . <p> One of the most glaring issues in my opinion on this locomotive is the VERY undersized drivers , but I have a solution to that , in my collection of stuff I have what appears to be Lobaugh 84 inch drivers , But I am not sure who made them but they do scale out to 84 inch Baldwin disc drivers , there is a set of 4 with different size weights . The axle hole has a keyway in them like Lobaugh or maybe another kit manufacture ? But I have never seen any like these , the only other locomotive that I know of to have this style with the 84 inch drivers was the Pennsy S 1 . I plan on using these drivers even if I have to build a new frame and whatever else I need to do to make it work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I love about the 3460 Class Hudson 's and I look forward to operating in on my O Scale 2 Rail Outdoor Layout . <p> PRRJIM nice to met you . Your right Max Gray Made the 3460 class but it is rather scarce . There was on evilbay about a month or so ago , if I remember right the starting price was over $2000.00 , way out of my price range . <p> The seller mentioned there was only 20 imported , weather true or not I do n't know , all I know is it was the first one I have seen for sale in a lot of years I have been looking . <p> By your name you must be a Pennsy fan , I am rather fond of Pennsy steam myself . <p> They look like Lobaugh . You are on the right track ; the MTH drivers are strangely insulated . You may need to make frame and side rods . For sure measure the cylinder block - you may find it seriously undersize . <p> Consider a 653-6 NWSL gearbox . You can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paint . Been there . . . <p> Even the Max Grey did n't have exactly 84 " drivers they come out to about 81 " - 82 " , undersizing drivers a little is n't uncommon . A compensation for larger flanges I guess . I 'd guess the MTH has too short a driver wheel base . ( cTr .... Choose the Right ) <p> BOB2 and STEPHEN BLOY and everyone else , thanks for the replies . It looks like a frame , Trucks and Siderod replacement among other things will be in order to get this old girl looking right . Below is more photos showing how far off MTH was on the driver size . <p> As far as I can tell the tender is n't to shabby and the basic body of the locomotive is not to bad either , still a lot of mods will be in store for it . I just hope I will be up to the task and with this forums help I will . Hopefully I will be able to produce a locomotive I will be proud of . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ran half way decent even with my Old Lionel ZW for power that I converted to do DC 2 Rail . 175852 @qwx375852 <p> I have a stupid question . If you are going through all that extra work to make a new frame for the larger diameter drive wheels , have you checked to see if that MTH model of a Santa Fe 3460 class Hudson is dimensionally correct , overall ? <p> As a comment from somebody who would want to go the other way with a number of two rail models , and who is not even a fan of Hudsons , l vaguely think that maybe l remember there was a Pecos River Brass AT&amp;SF offering with a 4-6-4 wheel arrangement ? If that is wrong , ..... Sorry .. They may not be common or cheap , either . 175855 @qwx375855 <p> Hot Water you 're absolutely correct it would not be worth my time to rework the rest of this engine if it was not dimensionally correct . <p> Odd thing is the tender and main body seem to be pretty close , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the dimensionally incorrect cylinders . I think it would make a great looking locomotive with a lot of work . <p> I guess it boils down to how bad you want something , I have loved the 3460 class Hudson 's since I was a kid , my Dad and I whenever we would go to Topeka would always stop and pay our respects to 3463 and for me those 84 inch drivers were always a site to behold . <p> As far as the dimensions here is some pictures comparing the MTH 3464 with an O scale dimensional drawing of 3460 also known as the Blue Goose , if you look at the drawing it shows some of the location points of some of the parts hidden by the shrouding . The MTH loco measure out and look right on with the drawing , except of course before mentioned parts . <p> Franky-OGEE I may eventually get one of those Weaver Blue Goose to revamp as well . <p> COLORADO HIGHRAILER , BOB2 and JAY C I have one of those PECO RIVER BRASS 4-6-4 3450 class Hudson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my outdoor layout , It is scaled right and the LFM Disc Drivers look cool . The 3450 class Hudson 's were smaller than the 3460 class Hudson 's , they were more of a hopped up 3400 class 4-6-2 with a 4 wheel trailing truck and 79inch drivers in their later rebuilds . <p> Of course I agree with everyone it 's a matter of taste and opinion . <p> If you get a chance check out my blog I have a picture and a video of my 3451 , made a mistake though it is not completely on the track when I took the picture of it , I have been to lazy to change it out . <p> BOB2 thanks for the tips on the ALL Nation cylinders and other stuff , you made me glad I am not the only person who will take a perfectly good running engine and hack into it because you do n't think it looks right . Do you have any pictures ? <p> The best of luck modifying the model . Yes , the drivers are undersized and the rods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dimensions of the MTH model . What is the diameter of the smokebox and the rest of the boiler running back to the firebox . If the model 's boiler dimensions are very close to the prototype , then I feel that you picked a good candidate for modeling an accurate model . <p> As for the drivers that you intend to replace the undersized MTH drivers with ; they might be the correct diameter ( 84 " ) , but do n't forget to take into account the axle spacing of the drivers when laying out the frame . Model drivers have much larger flanges ( exception being those who model P48 ) and you will have to see if the 3 pairs of connected drivers will fit between the rear of the cylinders and the front of the firebox without hitting the adjoining flanges . <p> Thanks Stephen . I just realized I have no photos of the Lionel FEF as 2-railed . Maybe a photo shoot in the next couple days . Here is the MTH Hudson . Those are 80 " Lobaugh drivers , with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and some files . Frame is brass , cylinders are AN Mountain , and l used all the rods and hangers from the MTH .

Herewith : 175852 @qwx375852 <p> Do n't mind at all . The only repetition I do mind is when folks endlessly repeat stuff in the same thread . ( read : endlessly = mindlessly ) . I even considered re-posting that here . I will disassemble the FEF for a similar shot . <p> No - but my frame construction technique is well known , both to OGR readers and OSN . I use 1/4 " x 5/8 " brtass bar and brass F/H machine screws . Once all machining is done and I am happy , I solder the entire thing together and sand off the screw heads . Looks a lot like a Lobaugh frame when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as promised , but did get some side shots . In the photos , I think all will agree that the Lionel drivers look better than the USH , but at least I did not have to machine eight steel tires .

@@36014859 @5014859/ <h> Santa Fe Red/Silver or Blue/Yellow ? <p> The Milwaukee Road had more than one paint scheme for their engines and I do n't know why but I know which one I like the most . I see that Santa Fe had two for sure , the famous war bonnet Red/Silver and the Blue/Yellow . Were there any others ? I prefer the blue/yellow over the iconic red/silver war bonnet combo . Was there any reason for the blue/yellow ? Also , of the two Santa Fe combos , which one do you prefer ? <p> I think red/silver was for passenger and blue/yellow for freight . Original intent did n't last though . <p> It lasted all the way to Amtrak . <p> Granted , there were exceptions : the FT set 167LABC was equipped with a steam generator and delivered in freight colors ( proof of concept ? ) 10 more FT sets were converted and repainted in passenger colors for several years before returning to freight duties and colors . <p> Also the 325 class F7 's , while painted in passenger colors , were geared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duties . <p> " Freight " locomotives in " passenger " colors began in ernest in 1989 with the introduction of Santa Fe 's " Super Fleet .

In 1955 , the Milwaukee signed a deal with Union Pacific to run UP passenger trains between Omaha and Chicago . UP did n't reach Chicago , and had previously used C&amp;NW to get their trains to Chicago . One stipulation in the UP/Milw agreement was Milwaukee had to provide a certain number of passenger cars for the trains , and they had to be the same yellow and gray colors used on UP trains . After a few years , Milwaukee decided to just adopt the UP scheme for all their passenger cars and diesels . Freight diesels continued to use orange ( orange and black ) however . 175854 @qwx375854 175853 @qwx375853 <h> Block 175862 @qwx375862

The Brawa operating ski lifts seemed too expensive , so I decided to scratch build my own . The photos chronicle the building phases . The first photo shows the first phase of fitting the sub-structure to the existing layout . <p> Then the construction was moved to an adjacent room , where I used insulation board ( 1 " ) for the back support .

No way I could do what you did with this photo . <p> And Hotwater , <p> Thanks for the informative terminology lesson . On my railroad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The term " lash-ups " is essentially a railfan/toy train term . I understand it was developed by Lionel . <p> Right . Except that selector switch is ONLY for the train lined head light control , so when the Engineer needs the " rear headlight " for a reverse movement , the headlight on the complete rear of his MU consist turns on . <p> GENRAL NOTICE - Safety is of the first importance in the discharge of duty . Obedience to the rules is essential to safety . To enter or remain in the service is an assurance of willingness to obey the rules . <p> The term LASHUP is NOT , was NOT first used by Lionel . Not sure where or why this non-sense keeps coming up . <p> Charlie <p> Jerry Pinkepank , who is a highly-regarded railroader - authority on diesel locomotive model designation and former official at BN , presently a professional railroad consultant , among other professional positions - wrote an article which was published in Trains , years ago . The title was Lash ' Em Up and the subject was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operate in multiple unit consists . There was some information about jumper cables and receptacles , air brake operation , etc . Actually , it was a good article , and , even today , about 30 or 40 years later , it would still impart useful information to curious railfans . Because Trains is the most widely read railfan magazine , the term may have grown from that use of it in print . <p> He heard a Foreman utter the title of his article at some roundhouse somewhere . So , it really did get used somewhere on some railroad , but it is neither the common nor correct term for a locomotive consist . I never heard anyone say " lashup " in my 37 years of engine service and service as a Company officer n the Operating Department who worked closely with the Mechanical Department . Nor did Jerry Pinkepank , either , I 'll bet . But he needed a catchy title for his article about m-u operation . <p> Let 's not say " lashup " , except when discussing TMCC or Legacy control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " lash up " as a pejorative euphemism for any two or more pieces of model rolling stock hooked together ; irregardless of whether they belong , or not - in the same way as an argument is called a " bun fight " or " handbags at 10 paces . " <p> Lash up also has other connotations which I do n't propose to canvas on this here family forum . <p> I was sitting up in bed last night , on vacation in a different time zone and having had a cup of coffee later than I should have . My wife had fallen asleep during the basketball playoffs , and , after North Carolina finished off Oregon , I wrote what was practically a short book on the use of terminology and how it related to Erik 's masterful photos . But I awoke this morning and had second thoughts . This is Erik 's thread , about his beautiful photos , and I do not want to even appear to hijack it .

I was thinking last week before I got sick of writing into Lionel to suggest some sort of survey that they could set up on their website for a few months ( or some sort of timetable ) . It would have drop downs for certain fields like Steam , Diesel , Electric , then the next drop down would be Engine , Passenger , Freight or Other ( not sure what other fields could be inserted in either of those two ) . Then after that would be fill . So you could select Steam , then Engine , then pop in say L1A Mohawk , or maybe 1800 's 4-4-0 or something like that . My guess is though that they probably would n't go for it as they said their contact line takes suggestions . <p> My argument would be though that there could be a way to get a pulse on what people are thinking on a larger scale . Naturally of course this would have the drawbacks as whatever seemed to pop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they even decided it was worth while . I also thought to of the overloading the ballot box issue as no doubt many would be disgruntled with some things they want to be made . <p> Is there some other way perhaps that a little bird gets into their ears to trend the way more towards what is desired by modelers ?

@@36014870 @5014870/ <h> Custom polar express ; MTH Berkshire and tender <p> i thought I 'd share something I 've been working on . I wanted a better Berkshire locomotive for our polar express holiday layout so I bought a brand new MTH Berkshire that had everything I wanted the Lionel one to have . Firebox glow , speed control , chuff rate options , remote coupler , etc .. <p> i painted them with an airbrush , then used krylon 's matte finish from a rattle can to give it a dull coat to match how the train Would come from a factory . I then had the " Polar Express " lettering made at a local sign shop . They did an excellent job creating the proper font and size . <p> i also painted 5 of mth 's 60 foot Madison cars with the proper polar express colors . They are nice cars with the diaphragms and they will run on the tighter turns of the fasttrack that I already had from our Lionel polar express set . I also weathered the passenger cars to look like they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the cars when I get a chance . <p> HI , yes I had to repaint everything because the locomotive was painted gray in the front half and the firebox was gray as well . It also had other detailed painting on other parts . The Windows were red , etc .. Also the tender had a bunch of lettering on the upper middle and lower portion . The Berkshire was MTH 's RF &amp; P Berkshire . I used paint thinner to remove all the old lettering and used 800 grit sand paper where needed . I did tape off the white stripe tho . I liked it and did n't want to have to repaint the stripe . <p> i will say this , it was very scary taking something brand new that I just paid a few hundred dollars for and stripping the paint off ! Lol but it turned out really good and looks like it was purchased this way . This was my first time doing this so I was pretty nervous . The other thing I found was an airbrush is imparitive when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes out nice . I bought an airbrush just to do this project and it was my first time using one . A single action airbrush is what I used because it 's the easiest to learn on . Krylon matte finish is great too . I have used testors dull coat and I kinda like the krylon better , it 's a smoother dull coat finish than the testors brand . ( From my experience ) <p> if you want a nice berk to pull polar express cars , I think this is the way to go . Unless you can afford Lionel 's legacy Berkshire . <p> Anyway , I 'll post the pics of the passenger cars That I repainted and weathered soon , and I 'll put a video on YouTube once it 's around the tree this year . <p> Thank you so much . I 'm working on the announcements now . MTH has a custom announcements option with their system and I 'm hoping to use it to announce , " this is the polar express " and others . I was almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ berk and try to find a way to make it work ! Lol so I 'm hoping I wo n't need to do that and just utilize the MTH custom sounds , recording option . <p> A great idea . Since my painting skills do n't match yours , I took the Lionel conventional set Polar Express and added TMCC with cruise , sound , and fan driven smoke . I installed a sound module in the baggage car with a bunch of polar express sound clips that I can control remotely . <p> That 's ver cool ! Do they come pre loaded with sound ? Will it work with MTH ? And could i load my own sounds ? My MTH TIU has a custom sounds option but I do n't know of a way to keep hearing the engine sounds while I play a custom recorded sound . So I 'm looking for some way to load the sounds I want on something and be able to control remotely . <p> I feel like the sound thing is way cool for this hobby . It really makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ available , you will add your own sounds . Most of the sounds I found on the Internet , but if I sell something , I ca n't include anything that is n't royalty free , but you can download them and load them for personal use . I 'm planning on having some sounds that I record on a local rail line so that I can have some included sounds . <p> There 's no restrictions on how long the sound files are , some of the running sounds are five hour MP3 files . I also had one of these modules in a small building at York a couple of times , I had church bells , and a carousel , etc. in the building . <p> Pricing has n't been set yet , as I am still working on the configuration of the final product . <p> Wyatt 's Dad , thank you ! One thing your post did for me was to encourage me to pick up my airbrush and try ! I 've had it for a year and have been nervous about using it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give it a whirl ! Thanks for posting ! <p> OH good ! Yes definitely try it out . I know I was a bit nervous about using it but you 'll find out how useful of a tool it is and the finish is so nice using one . I looked up how-to videos on you tube so I knew what air pressure to use , how to thin the paint , etc .. <p> I used model masters paint . I mixed classic black and flat black 1/2 and 1/2 . I probably could 've just went with the " classic black " It 's their gloss black . Originally I wanted to make it inbetween gloss and flat but after I airbrushed it , it came out glossy so that 's why I used the krylon matte finish , which I 'm very glad it worked out that way because it really does look like a stock finish from the factory . <p> The lettering is the kind of material that window stickers are made of for signs on automobiles . I do n't know what the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do the lettering . I got all 5 of my passenger cars , the tender and locomotives lettering for 25 dollars . I could n't believe how cheap it was . The lady that did it , researched it and got the correct font , color , everything . So if your wanting custom lettering I 'd call some sign companies and explain what you are doing and tell them the approximate size of letters you want . I called a few sign companies and they did n't have a laser cutter and could n't do small letters . <p> Thanks for the paint info , all this is helping me to work up the courage to do the same sort of thing . <p> Would you give me the info for who you had the signs made at ? No use me running around if you have already found a source who understands the modeling issues . I am not sure about proper forum etiquette , if posting is inappropriate email in my profile is good . <p> Which air brush did you get ? I am in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try this and it sure is " scary taking something brand new that I just paid a few hundred dollars for and stripping the paint off ! " Especially if art is not really your lane . I am sort of frozen feeling like I have to get it right the first try and not sure how to even do it . <p> Also when you get a chance I am interested in seeing how the cars came out as well . <p> Hi good for you ! I 'm excited for you . The place I got the lettering done at was called ( Fast Signs ) in Roseville Ca . I 'll get you more info but I 'm just finishing up with work . The airbrush is a ( paasche ) single action airbrush . 20 to 25 pounds of air pressure . With the number 5 tip . You could use a smaller tip but I liked how the 5 made it quick and was a large spray pattern . I would get a single action if it 's your first airbrush . Dual action requires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ project to come out nice the first time . <p> Also , when you first use the airbrush , practice on some plastic water bottles first . Even if it 's right before you paint the train . You 'll need to thin most paints . I used oil based paints for what I did . You can thin them 50/50 . I used paint thinner . You 'll see a lot online about different opinions on what to thin with . Just go to a hardware store and buy regular paint thinner . <p> Also MTH paint finishes are not all that compatable with Krylon brand paint , so I just sprayed whatever I was painting with the model masters paint , ( using the airbrush ) then when I needed the krylon flat or dull coat , I was just painting over the model masters paint and did n't have an issue . When I did the passenger cars I used krylon 's burgandy rattle can and painted over the custom blue I mixed . I had a test car that the MTH finish kinda melted on , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get you the woman 's name I dealt with and she will probably remember me and just be able to remake what she did for me without her needing to do any research . <p> Also I 'll get some pics on here of the passenger cars . It 's funny they look just like the Lionel cars . <p> I was kinda frozen in fear too ... It 'll be okay . I just masked off the wheels and such on the locomotive and tender . I did n't think it needed to be taken apart . It was scary and I was looking at the train one day and just thought today is the day and I jumped into it . But I had practice spraying the Madison cars before painting the Berkshire . If you get splatters from the airbrush then the paint might be too thick . The model master paint needed that 50/50 mix of thinner and paint for sure . Feel free to ask anything ! Keith , who is a member on here totally helped me and I would 've screwed it all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Thank you so much . I 'm working on the announcements now . MTH has a custom announcements option with their system and I 'm hoping to use it to announce , " this is the polar express " and others . I was almost going to rip the electronics announcements out of our Lionel berk and try to find a way to make it work ! Lol so I 'm hoping I wo n't need to do that and just utilize the MTH custom sounds , recording option . <p> Your PE loco and passenger cars look great . For an easy sound option consider something like the iHome iBT55 MicroGo bluetooth rechargeable speaker . MSRP is $24 , but I found on shelf at local WalMart for $9.98 ( online WMT was more but staff said if needed - order online , ship to store and then take to electronics dept and they will price adjust to the $9.98 shelf sticker price . ) Also available at some PepBoys and on Amazon with a up and down pricing . It 's about 1.62 " square , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in and be taken out of O and O-27 cars . You can setup a playlist of Polar Exp songs and movie sound clips and control/play from your phone/tablet/iPod etc . I placed one in a Lionel 0-27 polar express car with great results . <p> For a more permanent mount , I 'm sure you can figure a way to get power from the pickup rollers , regulate it and connect to the micro-usb then speaker in car . <p> That 's an awesome idea ! Do you have a YouTube video of yours ? ? Seriously a great idea . Thank you for sharing ! <p> Apologies for not following up to your request for a video . I do n't have a video available from the iHome model but noticed that Eric Siegel ( ericstrains.com ) posted an April video using a similar b/t speaker that demonstrates the potential use of these b/t micro/mini type speakers . Good luck . <p> When they are available , you will add your own sounds . Most of the sounds I found on the Internet , but if I sell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ royalty free , but you can download them and load them for personal use . I 'm planning on having some sounds that I record on a local rail line so that I can have some included sounds . <p> There 's no restrictions on how long the sound files are , some of the running sounds are five hour MP3 files . I also had one of these modules in a small building at York a couple of times , I had church bells , and a carousel , etc. in the building . <p> Pricing has n't been set yet , as I am still working on the configuration of the final product . <p> John , maybe I missed update announcements by you but is this item currently available ? If it is , can it be bought at Hennings Trains and what 's the price ? <p> John , would your box car sound modual be avalible with different box car sounds included in one modual . It would be great to have it in one box car and that box car be able to play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sounds typicaly accosiated with a box car . Then you could sell a stock car version with different animal sounds like cattle , pigs ect . Also controling each car via tmcc is the real winner .

If I am not in a hurry I just place humble bids and then wait . Sometimes they go for very cheap prices , sometimes not . My trick is a low bid and then not even watch as auction progresses so I am not tempted to raise my bid . I get lots of K-line items cheap this way . <p> Jeoff , the 1/48 scale vehicle market is one of the least populated resources there is in O scale . Very Very few true1/48 scale vehicles have been manufactured . Most hobbiests are using 1/50 as a fair alternative and the 1/43 as next choice if properly placed on the layout can be a reasonable choice , and there are many to pick from in that scale . Make no mistake 1/43 is too big , but when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1/50 is available to some extent , but not in a wide spread variety unfortunately . <p> If some one with deep pocket were to invest in producing a true 1/48 scale vehicle assortment , I suspect there would be endless customers . <p> There is also the issue of ' foirced perspective ' when it comes to vehicles . I use all different sizes and where they are placed helps to set the scene . The smaller vehicles are at the back of the scene and the larger . . . . It all helps to add to the illusion of distance . My problem with vehicles is we are modeling the summer of 1940 and the selection is really limited . Russ <p> Why would manufactres do 1/48 scale when most world car and truck collecters are 1/43 and 1/50 scale . O scale is a minority scale , why produce vehicles for a minority ? <p> IF Athearn did so well with the 1/48 scale vehicles , would n't they have done more of them ? You can still find them for sale . Therefore 1/48 scale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . <p> Unless your railroad has a military theme , you will have a difficult time finding vehicles in 1/48 . There are many military vehicles in 1/48 including trucks and some cars . But they look distinctly military so would need modifications to work for most layouts . <p> The choice is really between 1/43 and 1/50 scale vehicles which are popular scales for model car collectors . Being frustrated by the lack of 1/48 vehicles , long ago I decided to make the standard for my layout 1/50 . Let me bore you with a quick comparison of the three scales : <p> In 1/43 scale , 1 real foot = 0.28 inches . <p> In 1/48 scale , 1 real foot = 0.25 inches . <p> In 1/50 scale , 1 real foot = 0.24 inches . <p> So the average 15 foot long car/truck would be : <p> 4.20 inches long in 1/43 <p> 3.75 inches long in 1/48 <p> 3.60 inches long in 1/50 <p> So the 1/43 model is almost 1/2 inch too long ( 4.20 - 3.75 = 0.45 ) , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3.75 - 3.60 = 0.15 ) . <p> There are many nice 1/50 vehicles on the market ( Corgi , First Gear , Lledo , Norscot , Ertl ) and some no longer made that can be found on ebay and at swap meets ( such as Athearn , Matchbox ) . On ebay there are dozens , if not hundreds , of 1/50 vehicles that get posted every day . As Jeff notes above , he uses a good strategy so that he does n't overpay . Patience is the key . Thousands of these models were manufactured so they come up for bid on ebay all the time . If you miss one because of price , it will most likely appear again within days or weeks . <p> I am currently working on collecting 1/50 vehicles for my layout that I am just stated to build . Here are a few photos of some of the 1/50 vehicles I have . These will eventually get modified and weathered when I put them on the layout . <p> Matthew Jones 175852 @qwx375852 <p> I am interested in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I like seeing the cars on the layouts and I am a car buff .

I have all traditional size freight and passenger cars or the smaller size so I bought a Matchbox 68 Mustang suppose to be 1/64 but when at home its too small . maybe I can use it in the background . Its nice looking , many have too gaudy a paint job or gaudy wheels , Hot wheels are the same size . Big cars and smaller cars like my Mustang are the same size in Hot Wheels and Matchbox . Target had a 10 pack where some of the cars might be about the right size but they were new and new cars are bland to me . There was a schoolbus in the 10 pack and it was too small . <p> 1:48 vehicles are out there , rare and unusual but some have been produced . Revell I believe made some and so did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1:43 . Some of these models are wonderful ; just too big or too small . <p> I had a thread on this subject a couple of months ago ....

I wanted to use a Matchbox one , too , but the darn thing isexpensive because it only came lettered with a beer brand slathered on it ( I wouldcure that problem pronto ! by changing bed , maybe lengthing chassis , etc . ) . Andlike the initiator of this thread , I bought one of those cattle trucks ( ca n't use themodern cab ) for the body , but it is HUGE . If it IS 1/43 , than some of this stuffadvertised as such must be a smaller scale.Spec Cast has International and White stake trucks that I will use around my stockpens . They are immediate postwar , but , like autos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of years , and they will pass for prewar . I think there is oneof them in my stone mill photo I posted on here yesterday .... 1/43 may be wrong , but it is available , and I have tired of doing without era correct vehicles .. after allI have that strange center rail , and I am not modeling dual gauge with 2 ' 4 1/4 " narrow gauge . 175855 @qwx375855 175854 @qwx375854 175853 @qwx375853 <h> Block 175862 @qwx375862

Because Circuitron is in business I ca n't show their schematic but the same no flash problem is exhibited when using this LED brand in the AF signal setup . <p> Bill rewired the AF signal as described in the OGR article making the signal frame and screw shells grounded , and each lamp bought out on individual wires . Now connecting the frame to positive supply Flash Return pin 4 orients the LED cathodes to the positive terminal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NPN transistor collectors . The LEDs are thus reversed biased and can not light ! <p> Assuming that the AF sockets could be insulated and correctly wired to the respective terminals , a second problem crops up . Note R12 and R13 shunting their respective NPN transistors . With LEDs drawing little power , both simultaneously light through their resistors , including them as an additional series current limiting resistor , ignoring the transistors turning on/off . All that happens is LEDs flash dim/bright/dim . Incandescent lamps , unable to draw sufficient current through the resistors , remain extinguished until shunted by the transistor . Of course , those resistors can be cut off , but I did not do this as these are not my boards . <p> The Circuitron board is specifically designed for LEDs but it too has a positive supply and NPN transistors , creating the same no flash condition as Depotronics for the AF signal . <p> I was musing out loud that the LED bulb maker would need to specify either negative or positive bulb tip types , until my wife pointed out you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AC as well ( wife 's a smart cookie , guess all my 45+ years of electronics must have rubbed off ! ) 175852 @qwx375852 <p> After some probing around and measurements , I found the boards were functioning but just not with the AF signal .

From examining the instruction manual LONG ... wiring hookup examples , it appears the controller 's internal relay ( I assume it is a metal contact relay , not solid state type ) common contact is connected to the auxiliary power supply hot terminal , thus that voltage would be passed into the flasher boards , causing damage . <p> Now if Lionel had " correctly " designed the controller so all the relay contacts were independent ( unconnected to any voltages ) , then you could wire it to trigger the boards . Of course you can use an external relay triggered by the controller that in turn activates the board , but just one more hassle . If adventuresome , I suppose you could open up controller to isolate the relay common contact from the auxiliary supply . 175854 @qwx375854 175853 @qwx375853 <h> Block 175862 @qwx375862

Winston Churchill <p> They pulled the U34CH out of the museum for restoration . Is it being cosmetically or operationally restored ? <p> Uh - no way the U34CH was pulled " out of the museum " as there is NO official railroad museum in New Jersey yet . The URHS ( owner of the subject U34CH ) has plenty of equipment but no museum site . The Boonton location is for restoring the URHS equipment with idea of if/when a museum site becomes reality they will already have restored equipment ready to go on display . <p> The URHS owns ( or used to own ? ) a pair of ex-Chicago &amp; North Western F7A 's that were restored to operational status plus repainted in Lehigh Valley red/black years ago . They were used on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for use at a tourist operation but were deemed not fit for operation .

I do know the URHS tries to lease equipment out to other operations as a source of revenue plus keep it in good working order so they are trying the best they can given the limitations facing them . <p> I used to live in NJ and when I moved out of state in 1991 the URHS was searching for a suitable museum location back then .

I think part of the problem is not so much a museum site but a location tied to same that also has at least a few miles of track to run excursions on as I believe that was one of the goals of the URHS . After all , trains that operate are a bigger draw to bringing in the public to visit compared to static equipment . That said , having stuff operate is not necessary . Look at the Railroad Museum of Pennsylvania as an example - all equipment is static displays and they do well enough . They do have the advantage of having a portion of the collection under a roof and of course , for those who want a train ride the Strasburg RR is right across the street . Not sure if the NIMBY factor is also in play against the URHS since most locations on active rail lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . Perhaps someone here who is in NJ can comment better on how the URHS is doing with choosing and/or funding a museum location ? <p> As for the U34CH restoration the plan is to do a cosmetic restoration . At the same time a mechanical evaluation will be done to see what needs to be done to make it operate again . So cosmetics first - in future perhaps it will run again as well . <p> If you do n't own a copy already , get the program covering the U34CH which Mark 1 Video produced . The video discusses the origins of the class followed by many scenes of the units in regular service . There is also coverage of the farewell excursion which was operated with a unit at each end of the train . <p> Good luck , <p> Bob 175852 @qwx375852 <p> I remember when the U34CHs were new .

I saw this video on YouTube , and before that , I had no idea what a U34ch even was . The only problem was that it was in 8 parts . <p> 645 posted : <p> AGHRMatt posted : <p> They pulled the U34CH out of the museum for restoration . Is it being cosmetically or operationally restored ? <p> Uh - no way the U34CH was pulled " out of the museum " as there is NO official railroad museum in New Jersey yet . The URHS ( owner of the subject U34CH ) has plenty of equipment but no museum site . The Boonton location is for restoring the URHS equipment with idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have restored equipment ready to go on display . <p> I can understand AGHRMatt 's confusion . The URHS is kind of like the FWRHS . It 's not technically a museum , but it has hosted events where it is disguised if you will as a museum . For example , the FWRHS hosts an annual open house with equipment displays , and signs that tells the piece 's history . The URHS does the same thing . <p> As with some of the others here , I really do n't like diesels all that much . Except for special occasions--such as the annual Christmas run of the first Lionel set I was given by my grandfather--I do n't even allow them on my layout <p> That said , if I *had* to select a diesel which turned me off less than the others , I would have to point at Alcos . Not any specific one , mind , but my admiration of the underdog makes me less hostile to them as a class than to EMDs or GEs .

@@36014882 @5014882/ <h> Basements ... Poured Concrete or Cinder Blocks ? <p> After living in a house all these years that does not have a basement , the wife and I are moving to a house that will have a basement . These are new houses and we are out and about searching for one at this time . Now I 'm not familiar at all with regard to basement construction . A few communities that we have looked at feature basements with cinder block wall construction . At other communities they feature basements constructed of poured concrete . <p> So the question that I am posing is .... which of the 2 is a better basement with regard to insulating properties , moisture penetration , prepping the walls for wallboard and such . I want to finish the walls and ceiling before building a layout so any information is greatly appreciated . <p> Poured concrete is a solid piece , whereas block is many pieces . The more pieces , the more places things can fail . If the house has a proper moisture barrier on the outside of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again ... one piece vs. many . I do n't  think I 'd pass on a house soley because its block , unless a home inspector found something wrong with it . <p> Your studs go from the toe plate on the floor , to the header attached to your joists above , so it shouldnt matter what its made out of for framing walls . I would n't frame a wall directly to the foundation walls . When you frame the walls , you 'll fill the stud bays with insulation , and you can put in whatever R value you want . A few feet underground , the temp is more or less constant anyways , so the basement should n't need much help from the HVAC . Make sure you do put in an air return in the basement when you finish it off . You 'll want that air recirculated through the unit for humidity control . <p> May just be a matter of symantics ... But be sure to distinguish between cinder blocks and concrete blocks . The latter are preferred nowaday since they are produced with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buy a home with " cinder block " construction . <p> As to the difference between concrete block or poured concrete ... If building a custom home , I 'd go with concrete block foundation . However , if I were buying a home already constructed , neither concrete block nor poured concrete would rule the house out if it had an otherwise " ideal " basement for a model railroad empire . <p> I would advise checking ceiling height . I have a semi-permanent crease in my forehead from the area where the heating ducts run . My layout shares a room with my workshop and I can only stand up straight on one side of the layout . I thought of going with a U shaped layout but that would have meant I could n't have stood up straight in 90% of the open area . <p> The REAL issue is water ! Any moisture that gets into the basement must be controlled and eliminated if possible . If the house is new enough then there should be a modern water-proofing system around the foundation . <p> Get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house and basement with the inspector . Ask questions and more questions , The qualifications and experience required by states varies . <p> The houses that I am talking about in this new community have the old cinder block basement construction . So what I am dealing with is the choice of a solid poured concrete basement or one constructed of old style cinder blocks . <p> I am somewhat familiar with CONCRETE block construction , however , I have not come across that basement fabrication in my search for a new home in the area that I am looking at . <p> Cinder block would tend to date the house . Most construction 1960 to present would have concrete cast block . Cinder block tends to be more pourous , a black , gritty dust when drilled , and soft in comparison to aged concrete block , which can be difficult to drill . Today , in Pennsylvania , under the UCC , Universal Construction Code , the block walls have to be rodded and concrete poured in the block cells . Not all the cells , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detail and expense , a lot of builders just go with the poured concrete wall v.s. the block lay-up . <p> Moisture control has a lot to do with the outside membrane installation and proper drainage from the footer area as has been mentioned . <p> Also most homes technically do n't heat or air condition the basement area . The HVAC systems were designed to heat the living space above . There may be a few vents to the basement area . Appropriate climate control in the basement is a whole other discussion , that relates to a train layout , or for that matter converting the area to living space . This may require additional mechanical equipment . <p> I agree with you with regard to cinder block construction " dating the house " . But these are new houses , many of which are yet to be built . Most likely it is concrete cast block , and appropriate structural detail has been done to pass UCC inspection . There should also have been a footer inspection and waterproofing inspection . There are some interesting products out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall that is a good bit different than the traditional block construction . <p> A lot of newer poured foundations are done with foam panel forms which remain in place . They act as a moisture barrier and add insulation value . In addition the basement floor is poured on the ground surface rather that digging a hole . Then fill is brought in to grade up to the first story . Ground water issues are eliminated . <p> Were I to build a home , it would be with poured concrete walls in the basement . <p> Crushed stone under the basement floor is a must . <p> Exterior waterproof membrane is a must . <p> Proper grading and adequate distance from the home 's siding and the ground is a must . <p> The system Norton described sounds interesting . <p> And add my name to the list of folks who mentioned making certain the basement will have enough headroom . <p> When one of my buddies custom built his home , he put foam insulation under his basement floor and on the outside of his poured concrete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dry and warm . The insulation has not created any negative issues . <p> A lot of newer poured foundations are done with foam panel forms which remain in place . They act as a moisture barrier and add insulation value . In addition the basement floor is poured on the ground surface rather that digging a hole . Then fill is brought in to grade up to the first story . Ground water issues are eliminated.Very good website . Note that in addition to the form value and insulation there are both interior and exterior attachment channels and there should be mechanical space available for plumbing and electrical rough-ins . <p> Check out the post I made last night , " I 've been working on the railroad room " . There are a few pictures of my construction project . My basement is poured walls and there is a french drain around the edges of the slab . This is just a 1/2 inch gap between the walls and floor to keep the water from getting onto the floor and keep it in the sump . My walls were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the wall a couple inches . The big thing to look for is ceiling height . Poured walls may not be as tall and the finished room may have some head space issues . You will find that the floor is not level and you will need to level everything from the top down if you want to install dry wall . I did n't put the drywall all the way down since the bench work is going to cover that area . Feel free to contact me if you have any questions . I hung 45 sheets of drywall in the finished side of the basement befor I decided to build a train room . <p> I have decided to look carefully the next time the wife and I visit these new communities to see exactly what they are doing regarding basement construction . I 'll ask a lot of questions and hopefully actually visit a job site to see firsthand the construction techniques and materials that they are using . Hopefully that will happen next week ; this week is getting my house in order to put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tall enough to provide 9 ' 6 " from the floor to the bottom of the joist or truss cord . This will permit adaquate space for HVAC and dropped ceiling yet provide a standard 8 ' finished ceiling height . <p> Consider proper grade/swale design with generous roof over hang and down spout runoff . <p> Both an external and internal footer french drain with 120 utility and 12 volt Watchdog back up battery system . Check the Granite nature of your area for radon issues . If there are radon issues an extra sump with a sealed top for a remediation pump is a handy extra , and cheap to add at this point . <p> If the floor is not poured at this point you may wish to run some electrical conduit . <p> In our last place I had a 3 step down - 3 step up short depressed passage instead of a duck under for the RR . An idea I picked up at Cherry Valley RR club . Cost a few hundred extra while under construction . <p> Stair case position will be very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accomadate benchwork . <p> Be careful where any interior meters or valving is placed . Make sure the electrical service entrance will not interfere with benchwork or traffic . <p> Tankless waterheaters will help cleanup the floor space and get rid of that ugly H2O tank . <p> Back up check valve for basement drain , toilet . <p> Make sure any ceiling mounted shut off valves will not be positioned over the layout . <p> Can the electrical service entrance/circuit breaker box be on the first floor anywhere ? <p> Now is the time to have engineering adjust beam size for needed support column location . <p> Make sure any water treatment access will be doable . <p> If you will be in this place during your senior years consider making it ADA compliant . Wider doorways , level finished floor surfaces , higher commodes . All special touches are must cheaper now . tt <p> Slightly OT but I thought the perfect house for a train nut would be built on a hill so that the basement would have a walk in ground level access on one side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even in New York State . <p> Check to see if its now code that a basement be poured concrete as some communities have adapted these by-laws . <p> Having an older house ( 1958 ) my house has cement block walls.They are alright , but it 's what they did at the time . <p> And do check for how many outlets are or could be installed as you may need several for your layout.And check how many additional breakers the box has for future reference . <p> If you buy an already built house , ask what their building technique was when constructing the basement , drains , sump pumps , outer barrier ( gravel , french drain , insulation , etc . ) . Sounds like a lot to ask but as you well know a home is a big investment that after the facts is hard to deal with and costly . <p> Also check the ceiling for places to install tract lighting and the feasibility of running the wires to them . <p> And as mentioned , check where the plumbing and shut offs run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although my basement was already finished.Not enough lights or outlets makes it rough trying to plan a layout . <p> If you have a block or concrete foundation wall a coat of Thoroseal will help minimize the moisture problem . It is available at Lowes and Home depot and is applied to the interior side of the walls . I do n't suggest using it to stop running water just to prevent dampness . <p> My basement is poured , reinforced concrete and features a walkout door to the patio . The exterior walls were sealed and I have not had any water problems ( yet ) in this 13 year old house . I , too recommend Thoroseal. ( sp ? ) <p> Now ... I wish I could say the same for the windows I 've replaced and now ..... a garage door has to be replaced . UGH ! Tom in pgh 175854 @qwx375854 175853 @qwx375853 <h> Block 175862 @qwx375862

I am running both systems on my layout . I have the power going into the fixed voltage 1 &amp; 2 terminals with the legacy wire connecting to the ground post on the output of fixed voltage 1 as the manual says . The problem happens as soon as I turn on track power . The Legacy engines work just fine but the DCS engines will start up immediately as if they were being conventionally controlled . I have tried to reset the TIU but the problem still occurs . I also went to the DCS setup option and made sure that both channels were set to DCS mode . If anyone has any idea what the problem is I would love to know . <p> I believe I presented my solution to you on an earlier thread of yours . It went something like this : <p> I got ta tell ya , I purchased one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my LIONEL Base 1-L to the DCS so I could run my LionMaster Conrail SD80MAC equipped with the LEGACY Control System through the TIU using the DCS Remote exclusively . Well , I chose to connect the Base 1-L directly to my terminal block , ( using 18 gauge wire from the " U " post on the Base 1-L to the negative side of the terminal block ) and control the Legacy engine with the Cab 1-L instead of using the DCS Remote . I have been able to run both the Lionel Legacy and MTH Proto2 and Proto3 Engines simultaneously using the Cab 1-L for the Legacy engine and the DCS Remote for the MTH engines .

They will also degrade the DCS signal . I suspect that this may be the source of Nick 's problem . <p> I control MTH with DCS and Lionel with Legacy . I do n't use the MTH #50-1032 cable to connect the TIU to the Legacy base . You only need that cable if you want to control Legacy/TMCC engines with your DCS remote . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . <p> I wired my layout for DCS as close as possible to the guidelines in Barry 's book ( above ) . I had DCS for a few years before adding Legacy . When I got the Legacy system I connected the Legacy signal wire to the output common ( black ) terminals of my TIU and jumpered all of the TIU common terminals together . I have no problems with either DCS or Legacy , everything works very well . This is the best layout I have ever had as far as everything ( Legacy/DCS ) working without problems . <p> Just a passing thought here , but in what order do you turn things on when you power everything up ? I have everything ( DCS , Legacy , track &amp; accessories ) powered by one power strip and it is all turned on at the same time . I have several spurs to park engines that are on toggle switches . The MTH engines do as you say when I turn on one of the sidings after the layout is all up and running . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good info in there that you will refer to time and again .

@@36014885 @5014885/ <p> I had a Dremel it self destructed I used maybe a dozen times in 2 years ! <p> I would look for a heavier duty unit and preferably non China price is cheap so are there products . only my opinion , I tried just finding the tool no kit involved seems like only way they sell dremels now . <p> I have several Dremels and have had no problems with any . By all means get one with a variable speed , now days I think they all do . The key is to keep dust and dirt out of it as much as possible . Also try to find a way to hold it so as not to block the air intake . I have worn out several Craftsman and other makes over the years . <p> Dremels are like wrenchs IMO . No one single tool will do it all . For soft detail work I like one of the smaller hand held units . For installing lotza track I lay the large unit with a flex drive cable in a padded tray and slide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old Roto brand tools . <p> One of the nicest things about Dremel is the friendly factory service . Quick turnaround and low or no charge . Dremel has taken over the Roto Tool line so they service both tools . <p> IMO , the cable drive or 90 degree head is the only way to get a nice square sliced end on installed rail . <p> Never have tried the cordless . <p> Pete , send your broken tool back to the factory . I had a similar incident with one of my light duty pieces . It was back in about a week and works perfectly today . Free . <p> If I was only going to have one Dremel it woukd be the large hanging ( laying ) unit with a flex shaft with an E-Z arbor . <p> When you install any drive adapter on the nose make sure the drive shaft is fully engaged in the coupling plus make sure the screwed on connecting collar stays tight otherwise you may wind up damaging the interface and you will blame the tool . Ask me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say that I recommend against the Dremel XPR-400 . They have a history of going up in smoke , and I got to witness that first hand here ! When I sent it in for warranty replacement , they sent me a Dremel 3000 as a replacement . This is a much more robust tool and handles the work with ease . The Dremel 4000 is the same tool with electronic speed control , probably an even better choice . <p> Well , I can attest to the fact that the 3000 I got has lots more power and runs a lot cooler than the XPR-400 . I was initially bummed out that I got a different one back , but after using it I realized it was a much better tool . <p> FWIW , I have an ancient Dremel in the 200 series ( do n't remember the exact number ) that I have had for 30 years . It 's a much smaller tool , but I 've abused the crap out of it over the years . The only thing I ever had to do is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a couple of years ago , it finally gave up . I still keep that in one of my toolboxes . <p> what is the difference between the 3000 and 4000 dremel is the 4000 a heavier duty model or ? <p> have you had any really hot air coming off of tool via the fan outlet ? <p> $oo <p> The only difference I know of is the 4000 has electronic speed control and not just a power control like the other models . I believe other than that , they have the same motor and the same specifications . <p> I know I love the dremel we have . I 've used it for everything , from polishing axles for cub scout pinewood derby cars , to cutting a big eye bolt off so I could replace our garage door springs . We 've had it for at least 10 years and it 's still going strong . <p> I do n't think I have ever had a Dremel in 40 years that I was n't able to burn out in short order until I got a flex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control burns up or the motor windings . I do like the pistol grip Li-ion unit I have but the charges do n't last very long for me . <p> The only time I get any hot air out of my 3000 is when I work it hard and long with something like the jigsaw accessory or the little planer . I think any tool that 's drawing an amp or more is going to exhaust some pretty warm air , I do n't think you get away from that . The air is what is cooling the motor . 1 amp at 120 volts is 120 VA , well over 100 watts . All that energy is not being converted to rotation , a lot comes out as heat . <p> within there site are some nice videos of the tool how to use care for worth the time to watch only cost was your time . <p> Since I have no intention of replacing what I have , it seems somewhat pointless to learn about taking care of a tool I do n't own . <p> As far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of years ago , and Dremel provided the Dremel 3000 tool as a replacement free of charge . Since my other Dremel has lasted about 30 years with only one shaft coupler replaced , I do n't expect to need another tool for some time . <p> I have no doubt that the Foredom tool is a fine tool , but I do n't have another $300+ to spend on something that works perfectly fine for everything I use it for . <p> I 've always preferred Dremel . I bought my first one way back in 1972 . It was a basic variable speed one . I loved that tool and used it for everything . A few years back when I purchased my current home , one of my first projects was to finish the basement . I used a drywall bit in it and was unaware of the consequences . It popped and shorted as it smoked and died . I was a bit upset as I had owned that Dremel for over 30 years . No problem purchasing a brand , Dremel was definitely the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speed model in the case and a dozen tools . Another investment I 'll never regret . Since then , I have found a deluxe model with variable speed and the flexible chuck so I do n't have to hold the larger unit . It was like new in the case with all attachments for $10 at my local Saturday morning flea market . I bought it as an emergency back up . I 've never had to use it and it 's sat under my workbench now for at least 3 years . <p> My recommendation is go with a Dremel . I would also recommend a variable speed model , and one that comes in a nice hard storage case with a few tools thrown in . <p> I do n't know what model it is , but , mine does not have the variable speed . I vary the speed with an old Dremel variable speed box . It will slow the thing down to a crawl where it will not melt plastic when I drill . Ca n't do that with the others . <p> Any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with re-chargable Lithium-Ion battery pack . Might be kind of handy for more portable work around and under the layout , in place of my VERY old corded model . <p> You do not have to buy it from Foerdom directly and pay full retail . I went thru Ottoferi and the link is the one I got and with all the extra other things and coupons it was $200.00 with free shipping . So continue to buy what you like , but as the one person stated he already went thru 2 DM at 100 ea . <p> And yes they do offer bench models with a base . <p> I am not kidding when I say 45 years . <p> Marty <p> I will probably get flack for this . But to **** with the Dremel products . I never really like the dremel products just to big for my hands and bulky . <p> You might consider the Foredom products , I recently had to replace my 45 year old <p> flexible machine . that 's right it lasted that long . I replaced it with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 8200 Dremel ? It is battery powered , with re-chargable Lithium-Ion battery pack . Might be kind of handy for more portable work around and under the layout , in place of my VERY old corded model . <p> Personally , I 'd steer clear of the battery powered models . I 've used a friend 's , but I was not impressed with the power compared to even the smallest of the corded units . Battery life was nothing to write home about either . <p> I have an older corded Dremel , along with a new 8200 lithium-ion 12v tool . I do both trains and R/C aircraft with the 8200 . If I had to buy just one tool , it would be the 12v lithium-ion 8200 . Great tool , plenty of power and quick charge times . <p> I am wondering how the folks who have problems burning out their rotary tools are using them . <p> As I recall , the directions that come with the Dremel tools caution the User to let the high speed of the tool do the work . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to apply less pressure to the work . <p> I purchased my first dremel ( 260 ) in the 1970 's , and more recently a newer model ( 398 ) because I wanted some of the accessories that did n't fit the old models . I probably do not use them as much as many of the folks here , but both run fine , and I do not recall running into any problems with overheating . <p> I 've used my 398 with the mini circular saw attachment to trim siding , and open up the back of a china cabinet to covert it into a stereo cabinet . My older son has used it to cut openings in automobile dashboards . <p> The 398 got dropped once . One of the bearings that is pressed onto the armature shaft shifted , causing the unit to bind . Dremel sent me a new armature assembly . But I did n't have to put it in . Turns out , it was easy to get the bearing back in place . <p> Lithium ion and Lithium polymer batteries are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As long as there is a provision for easily replacing the battery in the 8200 , it will eventually give out , I would n't hesitate to pull the trigger on that model . <p> In my case , I was using it as designed , but apparently the XPR-400 was one of those lemons that occasionally gets out the door . As I said , the other models have served me well . <p> I 'll also add that I have a cheap rotary tool that I bought at Lowes for $20 a number of years ago , and I 've used it a lot as well , and it 's still going strong . It has variable speed and works as well as my smaller Dremel for the same jobs . The only thing I 've had to do to that one is replace the power switch , the original bit the dust after a few years of use . It 's cheap enough that I toss it in my traveling toolbox just to have one handy . <p> Lithium ion and Lithium polymer batteries are re-writing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As long as there is a provision for easily replacing the battery in the 8200 , it will eventually give out , I would n't hesitate to pull the trigger on that model . <p> Pete <p> From a review on Amazon . This is one concern of mine regarding tools that do n't offer removable batteries . <p> The new 8220 has the newest Lithium battery so I 'm hoping it will last longer than the 8200 which has mixed reviews on the battery . For me , the price difference between the 7700 , 8000 vs 8200 was justifiable because a replacement battery quickly makes up the price difference . I dremel once a week or two - even at that rate the old NiCad and NiMH were not holding charge very well . <p> Yes , I can take it apart and replace the battery , but I 'd rather have a tool that has a battery designed for user replacement . <p> Thanks guys . Our local Home Depot has the newest Dremel #8220 listed for $99 , but appeared to be out of stock . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , also for $99 , but I do n't need any more attachments nor a caring case .

The 2 loco 's are Lionel , and my question is what is the BEST power system so I can run Lionel , and other manufacturer 's loco 's ? <p> Hi Calvin , welcome to the world of model railroading . Do your two Lionel engines have TMCC or Legacy command control ? Are you planning on buying anymore engines and if so would they have command control ? Lionel has a TMCC/Legacy command control system that Atlas , and Weaver engines are compatible with . MTH has the DCS system that will run Atlas , Weaver and Lionel . Both of these systems are easy to hook up and easy to use . I would definitely go to a hobby shop that has these systems hooked up on a layout so that you could get a hands on idea of which one you prefer . A lot of members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that way I can run any engine with command control . If you are planning on enjoying this hobby for a long time , plan on getting both systems . If you are just going to run the engines in conventional mode , just get a goo transformer and start enjoying . If you woul like to , let me know what the engines are that you have and I can let you know what you may need to run them . <p> Calvin is being introduced to the wonderful world of competing command systems . There are many threads that come and go here about the pros and cons of the two . <p> As far as operation , either DCS or Legacy will give you a complete operating environment with control for locomotives , accessories , switches , etc . It really comes down to which manufacturer makes products that you 'd most like to own . In my case , I had TMCC , then Legacy , but MTH kept making some neat stuff as well , so I got the DCS system . This allows me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with them . <p> I 'd recommend you look around for a train club near you , many of the members will welcome you to their layouts , not to mention if they have a club layout . You can get your feet wet with both systems and also discuss what products are available from each manufacturer . <p> MTH 's system will only run those others in conventional mode ( by raising or lowering the track voltage ) or can run a older set of TMCC commands once you add a Lionel system to the MTH DCS system <p> If you only have Lionel now and have engines that are set up to run with command then you are better off starting with the Lionel system and then adding DCS . Judging by the picture of the transformer you have the engines may not be set up as coammnd engines . Taking some pictures of the engines and any product numbers ( ex 6-XXXXX ) or even engine cab numbers might help us find what you have <p> I ' m new to the Model Train community , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working toward starting my first O gauge layout . The 2 loco 's are Lionel , and my question is what is the BEST power system so I can run Lionel , and other manufacturer 's loco 's ? <p> ( emphasis mine ) Alll-righty then ! ( edit : I started my post right after gunrunnerjohn 's reply--three others posted while I was writing this ) <p> What you 've pictured is a starter-set transformer , and not a particularly powerful one at that . It 'll most likely run either of your two locos , but you 'll find it running out of horsepower pretty early in the game as you expand . The Z-1000 transformer by MTH is a good step-up in power . If you 're looking at top-of-the-line power , there 's the MTH Z-4000 , which has been around for many years and is highly regarded around here , or the Lionel ZW-L , which is relatively newer , but in the same " high power " class that generally means you wo n't need to upgrade further , regardless of how heavy your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with what amounts to a " digital engineer " that only responds to signals meant specifically for it . The track is electrified at a constant voltage ( usually 18 volts ) and the individual command-equipped locomotives only take what their electronics ( under your control ) tell them to take , by way of a remote control wirelessly linked to a control box connected to the track . The upshot of this is you can have multiple locomotives independently doing their thing all on the same track . <p> Neither system directly operates the other , but because Lionel made its TMCC control codes public ( at the time it was the only system around ) , that system 's control box can be operated by another computer connected to a serial port on its side . MTH took advantage of this while designing its own DCS system , and included the ability to connect to and operate a TMCC control box from its own system , as shown by the photo below:MTH kept its own codes a company secret , thus the DCS control box can not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , during the time TMCC was its sole command system , licensed the receiver electronics to a limited number of other manufacturers ( notably Weaver , Atlas O and K-Line ) to include in their own locomotives . This practice ended with the introduction of Legacy ( and a change of upper management ) . These companies can still include TMCC electronics in their locomotives--they just ca n't perform the same tricks Legacy units can . <p> In practice , both systems can operate on the same track at the same time , and those desiring the most flexibility have equipped their layouts with both systems . <p> As for control of engines not equipped with command electronics , both systems can operate conventional locomotives on seperate tracks . DCS has this ability built in . Both of Lionel 's systems require an additional box called a " Track Power Controller " that is basically a remote-controlled transformer handle that is hooked up between the track power supply and the track itself . <p> And last but not least , locomotives not equipped with command electronics can be equipped with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assuming the loco has flywheel-equipped can motors ) DCS upgrade kits . Legacy electronics are not available as a retrofit. 175854 @qwx375854 175853 @qwx375853 <h> Block 175862 @qwx375862

@@36014892 @5014892/ <h> Atlas O Turntable with MTH realtrax and DCS ? <p> I have a question about the Atlas O turntable and its compatibility with both DCS and the realtrax system . I have read that the realtrax will need to be cut " square " in order to work with the turntable . If possible , I would like to see a picture of this modification . Additionally , I am unfamiliar with the wiring of the track on a turntable . I would assume that I would be able to control my DCS locomotives by remote while on the turntable . Can someone confirm this for me ? I am less concerned with controlling the actual turntable rotation by DCS ( AIU ) , but very concerned with being able to control my trains ! <p> Based on the responses I get from this post , I 'm considering installing the turntable on my layout . I have the space for this model , but do not have space for anything larger . Additionally , for the price I do n't think this can be beat . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need a falt end to butt up against the turntable . As for DCS and Legacy control , as long as you have feeders on every turntable leg and good connections you will have no problems integrating your turntable in with your command systems <p> Use and modify the Realtrax " to " the turntable . You will have to cut away the plastic roadbed to fit . You might also have to make some height adjustments . Save yourself some pain and use Atlas Track for all of the " Whiskers " . The tracks ( TT and Whiskers ) get hooked up just like your main lines and DCS engines will work fine . <p> I have a bridge leading to my TT , so I just converted to Atlas track after the bridge . I do have some scaletrax ( not visible ) leading to the TT behind those Reading engines . You just have to play with he height adjustment . Here is my Atlas TT and Atlas track as whiskers . <p> Have Fun ! Ron <p> " I 'd rather be lucky than good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would think there should be a transition piece so you can transition from Realtrax to Atlas or Gargraves on the approach to the turntable . Then all the tracks connected to the turntable would be Atlas or something readily compatible . <p> Joe B. <p> President Emeritus of the Olde Newburgh Model Railroad Club , now retired and living the dream in Florida . <p> I run my Fastrack right up to my Atlas TT . As Ron045 said for the Realtrax , you just cut back the plastic road bed a bit , and it will butt right up perfectly and fit in the space for the track on the turntable . <p> I do use Atlas track for the legs going into the Roundhouse . <p> Then as far as DCS operation , just as others have said , just run the TT track power wires into your power feeds and the DCS signal will be present on the Turntable bridge . <p> Thanks for the responses everyone .

The smoke element ground is probably achieved through the casing being connected to the chassis . <p> Well I wired to test and the smoke unit works very good but the fan spun when track power was applied but does not puff .

If not , is there any additional equipment that would allow it ? <p> With two independent track loops , I 'm trying to figure out how I can best run both proto2 , tmcc and conventonal locomotives . <p> Buy Barry 's book on DCS . You are asking huge questions and they are not yes and no answers . Bary 's book touches on all of it . It was a huge help to me for understanding it all . We all have those same questions in the beginning . I downloaded book from the MTH website . There are also some good books on Legacy out there also . I know this is not an answer but the answer for me was reading a few books till it all sunk in . <p> Your first issue is trying to run 2 trains with the CW-80 . You are looking at 80watts , and 5 amps . That 's enough for one passenger train OR 2 freight trains , provided you go light on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running 2 trains , you need more power . You could add another CW-80 , or almost anything else to the package . <p> Question1 : In theory you can operate both TMCC and conventional on the same track at the same time . The usual problem is that TMCC units like 16v or better . Running most conventional engines at 16+ volts gets them flying along rather quickly . Watch out on the corners , especially with O27 track ! <p> Question 2 : The short answer is " Yes " , with the proviso on power requirements for 2 trains mentioned above . <p> Question3 : A DCS engine will operate in a TMCC environment , but in conventional only . If you add an MTH TIU to your system , you can run the DCS engine in command mode . TMCC CAN NOT control a DCS engine in command mode . DCS and TMCC can be operated on the same track at the same time . The control signals and equipment ( under normal conditions ) do not interfere with each other . <p> Question 4 : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have no experience with a DCS remote commander . <p> Question 6 : Same answer as question 1 above . <p> My advice : <p> 1 ) Up grade your power source . <p> 2 ) If you plan to run TMCC and DCS on the same layout , get the TMCC package with remote and command base , AND the MTH DCS system with the remote and TIU . <p> 3 ) For excellent help on using your DCS , post questions to the DCS portion of this Forum . Barry and others are an absolutely wonderful resource ! <p> You ask a lot of questions and I 'm sure there are others that even now are forming answers . Some general observations . A command base will not by itself give you remote control of a conventional engine . In each case listed the only control of the conventional engine will be from the CW80 transformer handle . To get remote control of a conventional engine you will need a TPC 3 or 4 or at least a Powermaster . <p> MTH does not recomend the use of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will work in conventional mode and some will do funny things . To run any PS2 or PS3 engine in command mode you must have some DCS controller . TMCC in any form will not give you command control of a PS2 or 3 engine . <p> Running two engines of any combination at the same time with one CW80 is iffy . You really should have more power . <p> Yes you can run conventional engines , TMCC engines , and DCS engines at the same time on the same track in either conventional mode or in command mode with their controllers given the following understandings . Any control action taken on the conventional engine , speed control , direction control , will have an effect on the other engines . Speed control will tend to affect the speed of the others to some extent . Directional control will stop all engines . The TMCC will need to be restarted and the DCS will restart on its own or may take off in conventional mode depending on the DCS signal . <p> Finally the DCS remote commander may not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a conventional engine at the same time . In any case the CW80 is not MTH approved . <p> First , the CW80 is an extremely poor choice for operating more than 1 engine at a time and is also not recommended for use with PS2 engines . I 'll attempt to answer your questions based on a transformer of adequate power and compatibility : <p> 1 . Can conventional and tmcc locomotives run simultaneously on the same track powered by a CW-80 transformer and controlled by a Cab- ! handheld and a command base ? If not , is there any add on accessory equipment that would allow it ? <p> Absolutely ! <p> 2 . Using a CW-80 transformer , CAB-1 and a command base - can two tmcc locomotives run on the same track simultaneously ? <p> Absolutely ! <p> 3 . Can a proto2 locomotive be run on a track controlled by a tmcc CAB-1 and command base with a CW-80 transformer ? If not , is there any additional add on accessory equipment that would allow it ? <p> No , because the Cab-1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under DCS . To do so , you would need either a DCS set or a DCS Remote Commander to operate under DCS , or a TPC or similar unit to operate PS2/PS3 , or any other conventional engine , conventionally . <p> 4 . Can a Proto2 locomotive and a tmcc locomotive run simultaneously on the same track powered by a cw-80 transformer with a tmcc command base and CAB 1 handheld ? If not , is there any additional equipment that would allow it ? <p> Same answer as #3 above . <p> 5 . Can a tmcc locomotive run on track controlled by a dcs remote commander ? If not , is thgere any additional equipment that would allow it ? <p> No . You need a command base and a Cab-1 , or a command base , a DCS TIU and Remote , and a connecting cable . A DCS Remote Commander can only run PS2/PS3 engines <p> 6 . Can a proto2 and conventional locomotive run simultaneously on track controlled by a dcs rempote commander ? If not , is there any additional equipment that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DCS Remote Commander can not operate the conventional engine . You 'd need a transformer throttle to control the conventional engine . <p> This and a whole lot more is all in " The DCS O Gauge Companion 2nd Edition " , now available for purchase as an eBook or a printed book from MTH 's web store site ! Click on the link below to go to MTH 's web page for the book ! <p> I can run two trains with my CW80 no problem . What I do is I set my Lionel Hogwarts train ( conventional ) on the track with 3 lighted passenger cars and smoke unit on , set the throttle on the CW80 and get it moving . Then I address the TMCC locomotive I want and get it moving , controlling it with the CAB1 . It 's easy . I 've tried 3 trains with the CW80 and that 's when it really started to struggle . They all ran but I was getting a whole lot of blinky light in the CW80 . <p> Thanks guys for advice given so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while , they 've all been conventional - running two independent loops of track each powered by its own CW-80 transformer . Then I saw a MTH Proto2 steamer I loved and purchased it . A forum member recommended the most economical way to get started in DCS was with a DCS remote commander set and z-500 transformer so I followed that advice and purchased two ( one for each set of tracks ) . Just last weekend my wife bought me a limited edition Atlas TMCC equipped SW 8 diesel which I wanted for quite a while . To activate the crew talk I had to run TMCC so I purchased CAB-1 and command base units from a forum member . <p> That 's basically what I have and the situation I 'm in - trying to find the simplest yet best , most economical way to integrate these three different systems of conventional , MCC and DCS using the equipment I 've already invested time and money into for my two independent track loops layout . <p> Many of you advise it ca n't be done using the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two CW-40 transformers from two other starter sets ) , so what would all of you suggest for powering these two independent loops of track ? Can I be successful in what I want to do using a combo of all these transformers rather than investing more $ into a different one ? While economics is definitely to be considered I do n't want to be shortsighted and penny wise , pound foolish as they say . <p> Finally , Barry 's book is obviously the one and all go to source for MTH DCS , but what book would be considered a similar all encompassing authoritative source for TMCC ? <p> Remember that conventional engines are controlled by changes in track voltage and the DC signals sent on the track for Whistle/horn and bell . So a device to control track voltage is needed . Transformer handle works , or a Power Master which can read CAB-1 signals to change voltage on the track and send the DC signals also works . This gives you TMCC remote capability to run conventional trains . <p> Adding the TMCC command base @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mentioned you need to pick conventional engines that run at 12-14V if you still want your TMCC engine to run satisfactorily . While it can be done , you wind up running the conventional engine at one speed so it is not very satisfying , unless you have a large layout . G <p> I 've fooled around with trying to run conventional and DCS or TMCC on a single power district , and the results are not very satisfactory . My advice would be to keep the conventional on one track and run the command stuff on the other . You can freely mix DCS and TMCC stuff on a single track . <p> As I see it that is not what you said you had the first time . Let 's start over . You have two ( 2 ) loops of track with one ( 1 ) CW80 connected to each and one ( 1 ) TMCC command base connected to the two loops . You have obtained two ( 2 ) DCS remote commanders and a z-500 brick for each but have not connected them up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better than the CW80 for the PS2/3 engines , however it does not have as much power for running the train . I hate to say it but you really need a z-1000 or better to replace each CW80 . <p> If you insist on running engines conventionally you need someway to control the voltage . If you use a brick like the z-1000 to supply power you will need either a Powermaster or a TPC 3 or TPC 4 . If you find an older Lionel transformer like a 1033 or LW to replace the CW80 's you could use that but you will not have remote control of the conventional engines , Transformer control only . <p> There is another option that actually will be better in the long run . Sell the two DCS remote commanders and the z-500 's and use the money to buy two z-1000 power bricks or even better two Lionel 180 power bricks . Then invest in a DCS TIU and controller set . The DCS TIU has 4 output channels and two of them are set up already to control conventional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conventional engines , command control of your DCS engines , and if you add the MTH connecting cable between your TMCC command base and the TIU , you will even be able to control your TMCC engines with the DCS controller . You will have a much better setup that will not have so many pieces and give you better control . 175854 @qwx375854 175853 @qwx375853 <h> Block 175862 @qwx375862

MTH makes a VERY nice replacement in its Z-1000 transformer and it can run just about every make and model . <p> Gary ; If your train budget will allow it , consider either a newer version Lionel ZW or the MTH Z4000 . Both are excellent and will allow for expansion of your empire .

The new Lionel ZW is also a good choice . The transformer is one of two areas where you ca n't cut corners . The other is the structural materials for your layout -- use the good stuff . <p> With rolling stock , what I 've found is that operationally , the bulk of 3-rail rolling stock from the major manufacturers works well together . Some precautions need to be taken -- heavier , short rolling stock near the locomotive(s) and longer , lighter rolling stock toward the rear . <p> As for locomotives , MTH Proto-2/Proto-3 engines ca n't be MU 'd with Lionel TMCC/Legacy engines , but both types of engines can be operated separately at the same time on the same layout if you have both command systems installed . We do it all the time at the club . <p> Hope this helps . 175856 @qwx375856 <p> If you want to run some MTH then the Z1000 would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lot 's of people use them , they just are not compatible with an MTH engine . <p> That 's how I would put it , as well . The CW80 is probably fine if you 're going to operate Lionel trains , but I do not recommend it for MTH locomotives . MTH does n't recommend it either ( they list about 25 compatible transformers in their owners manuals ) . The Z1000 is an excellent small transformer . I used one for my tinplate layout ( until I switched to the DCS Remote Commander last week ) and used a couple of them on my regular layout until recently when I bought a Z4000 . The Z1000s will now be used to power accessories . <p> You can run material from all the vendors . I do agree with the opinion regarding the Lionel CW-80 ; however , Lionel has made " fixes " to the CW-80 and I do not have any experiences with that device . You will get many opinions - filter out the miss-information which may be difficult . A vendor in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hudson ) kept making the statement that Legacy and DCS were not compatible and that a CAB2 could be burned up as a result . I even have an email from a Lionel tech at stated <p> quote : <p> Conventional Accessories should run fine on the 50 Hz . Anything that is TMCC or Legacy operated will need to be on the 60 Hz or it will not work . <p> Take any information with a grain of salt and evaluate . I have photos on my web site of a layout in germany Albrecht 's layout where you can see Legacy , TMCC and Proto 2 engines running simultaneously in a 50 cycle environment . On my own 14 loops , I run proto2 , Legacy , and TMCC simultaneously without any issues ( multiple Proto2 consists followed by a Legacy or TMCC consist ) . Regarding your original question of transformers I am currently using 5 Lionel 180 bricks , 3 MTH Z4000 's , one MRC Pure Power Dual and two PW Lionel ZWs . As you can see from my layout I mix and run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only one I do not have with MTH Proto2 engines , Lionel Legacy engines , Kline TMCC ( two also converted to Proto2 ) , SMR ( ERR and Proto2 conversionS ) with a 3rd Rail ERR expected before Christmas . It is very nice time to be in the hobby where you can purchase a product from alomost any vendor and not having to be concerned about whether it runs well with the other products you have purchased . <p> If you upgrade your transformer for track power you can use your cw-80 's to run your accessories . Wiring your accessories to the throttle side allows you to adjust/tune voltage for the recommended voltage/best operation . <p> The voltage at the accessory side of the CW-80 is programmable , a very cool feature indeed . <p> I never had a CW-80 until this Christmas when it came with a Harry Potter set . I was a bit worried about it until I used it , its actually a nice little transformer . It ran the Hogwarts just fine with 3 lighted cars. , The handles had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nicely <p> Granted there are some lemons out there , but when it works it works nicely <p> Notice how the smooth sine wave we associate with AC power is chopped up into a series of shark-fin shaped waves ? When most MTH electronics see that kind of power , they go " this does n't look kosher " and refuse to leave their startup mode . Some people have gotten around this by holding down the direction button while raising the voltage to the point that the " shark fins " are mostly smoothed out , then releasing power to the engine to get it out of start-up mode . This may become tedious , though . <p> The easier solution is to use a Z-1000 , which runs everything ( and gives you an extra 20 watts of capacity ) , and dedicate the CW-80 to accessories or other functions that are n't bothered by oddball manipulations of AC power . <p> Gary , are you interested in knowing just about the engines and transformers , or other things too ? <p> For the transformers , generally speaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above , most transformers both old and new of whatever brand will run anything . I say that having tried a lot of them ( not including the CW-80 ) . I 've tried Lionel 1930s Pre-War , several Post War , the modern New ZW , the Z-4000 and many in between and they all seem to get the trains run OK as far as that 's concerned . What you run into though is aside from the trains , some transformers have " issues " peculiar unto themselves and some are more desirable than others . There 's also obviously the question how much power you require . And you may have an issue of electronic parts availability with some modern transformers or controllers . <p> As for non engine concerns , you also have some compatibility issues regarding different brands of O Gauge couplers . Generally , they can be made to couple to each other and keep trains together regardless of brands , but they 're not all equal in how well they do it or how well they mate to each other . On a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weight problems , or the lack thereof . <p> The easier solution is to use a Z-1000 , which runs everything ( and gives you an extra 20 watts of capacity ) , and dedicate the CW-80 to accessories or other functions that are n't bothered by oddball manipulations of AC power . <p> -------------- <p> Today I tested a Z-1000 on an MTH Imperial K4 ( PS2 ) hauling the Lionel South Wind passenger car set ( 15340 ) along with the matching South Wind add-on station sounds diner car ( 15385 ) <p> The MTH K4 operated fine ( in conventional mode using the Z-1000 and its controller ) . The Lionel station sounds car experienced bizarre glitches such as blinking interior cabin lights ( it flickered on and off like on the Harry Potter Dementors passenger car ) . But after a couple of presses of the Direction Button , the flickering turned off . The Z-1000 triggered the station sounds just fine ( well , to a degree ) .

The flickering did not occur in any of the other South Wind passenger cars -- it only occurred in the station sounds car . <p> There must be some interference or incompatibilities between the MTH Z-1000 and the Lionel South Wind station sounds diner car ( released in 2003 ) . <p> The MTH TIU and handheld remote ( at constant 18v track voltage ) is unable to activate the Lionel station sounds in the diner car . Either my Lionel station sounds diner car is possessed or there are clearly some incompatibilities . <p> When I finally receive my pre-ordered Lionel Legacy 990 and hook it up to the track and TIU I will test the Lionel station sounds diner operations again to discover if the MTH and Lionel systems co-habiting the track will play nice together .

I run only conventionally land in my experience nothing runs locos - Lionel , MTH , or Bachman - better in conventional than the Lionel ZW-L , but that is a lot of coin for a power supply ( it 's a lot of power supply , too , but you got need that much to make it worth you money ) . <p> If you have a bunch of MTH PS-whatevers and need a power supply , why not get a MTH 1000 ?

@@36014898 @5014898/ <p> In short , it is the features that each system has that sets them apart from one another . I do n't have any of the systems , but I am familiar with the 990 . Which appears to be the best system to have with Legacy controlled locomotives . I am sure there are many members up in here that have all three or at one time at had all three and can tell you what you want to know about each . <p> There are only two systems - TMCC and Legacy . Legacy was referred to as TMCC II when it came out as it is the successor for the original TMCC system . It someone lists an engine as TMCC II , its a legacy engine . <p> The legacy system will run TMCC engines better because it uses absolute speed steps to control the engines . The CAB1 used relative speed steps . TMCC engines support both features but the CAB1 never took advantage of the other speed steps . <p> In regards to quilling whistles and horns , that is an engine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feature . Odyssey II is more refined speed control over the original Odyssey system . You will have finer control over the engine and it will run even smoother . Some original Odyssey I engines would tend to jerk at very low speeds which forced the user to bump the speed up one or two speed steps to smooth it out . You wo n't see any problems like that with Odyssey II . <p> Nope Joe , operating older TMCC engines with the DCS control gets you TMCC performance . Remember , you 're actually just using the DCS as a remote , the commands are being issued by the Lionel command base cabled to the DCS TIU . <p> As far as older Legacy vs. newer Legacy equipment , there have been continual updates in various aspects of the operation . One thing seems to have remained constant , the Odyssey II speed control and the 200 speed steps is the same from the early Legacy stuff to the latest . I have some pretty old Legacy locomotives , they have excellent speed control and the quilling whistle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ controls , sequence control , etc . The packaging of the electronics has evolved over the years , early Legacy had packaging very similar to TMCC locomotives with the R4LC and the DCDS modules . The sounds were still the standard RailSounds power supply with an upgraded audio board . The new Legacy stuff has an all-in-one board that has a piggyback TMCC receiver . The board controls motors , smoke , lights , etc . RailSounds is not a single board . <p> Is n't there a 100 speed step mode or something with DCS running TMCC stuff ? Or something running TMCC stuff anyway ? I may be dreaming , but I think I remember reading that somewhere here on the forum . I do n't have any TMCC and the old memory does play tricks on me every now and then though . <p> The 100 speed step mode only works for TMCC stuff that supports 100 steps , standard TMCC or Odyssey I is 32 speed steps . If you have an ERR upgrade or the TAS EOB , you can use them through the DCS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Lionel remote . <p> To someone who runs conventionally , like me , there is a big difference between three generations of these electronics . TMCC locos will run in conventional , but many jackrabbit on start and do not respond very linearly to the throttle or run smoothly at really low speeds . Legacy locos do a lot better . Then , about three years ago , Lionel made is additions to Legacy boards about three years ago to provide the " Refined Conventional Transformer Control mode with slower starting speeds " as advertised in a bullet in catalogs . Legacy locos since then are the best conventional runners I have seen , period ( even better than purely conventional locos ) with regard to how smoothly they run at really low speeds , etc . <p> Good point Lee . I do n't run them conventional , and I see no significant difference between the older and newer Legacy locomotives . I suspect that change came along with the integrated electronic package , it 's a totally different design from the look of it . <p> Thanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were different versions of TMCC . I will probably have only Legacy and MTH stuff ( mostly PS3 ) , but you never know ? I have n't even bothered connecting my DCS to my Legacy base . May be the odd man out here , but I still like having two different systems and two different remotes. 175854 @qwx375854 175853 @qwx375853 <h> Block 175862 @qwx375862

He 's out of town right now but we plan on dealing with it upon his return ( today or tomorrow ) . <p> I 'm thankful that Jay is continuing to provide the Right-O-Way product line . I 've installed a very large number of turnouts on the railroad using ROW castings . They are time and money savers - and the look ca n't be beat . <p> I tried recently to place an order by mail with Right o ' Way at the Chowchilla , CA address that the late Mr. Cross used for many years ( and which still appears in the O Scale Directory ) , but the letter was returned as undeliverable .

I recently got one of his new products , a bottom retainer plate for Atlas SW trucks that narrows up the the mounting of the side frames . They are a snap to install and really improve the look of the Switcher . The website is now mostly working and you can use PayPal <p> The RH uses a frog from Jay while the LH is one I made using code 148 rail , also from Jay . <p> I 'm still using hi-rail wheels and they hit the bottom of Jay 's frog , so I thought I 'd try to make that to see if the wheels hit , they do n't . So now I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably keep the hi-rail wheels on my engines ( too costly to change ) and change out the wheels on my rolling stock to 2-rail . <p> I wish I could put these 2 turnouts in a loop to really test them out . I 've managed to put a piece of ME flextrack on both ends to see if there was any issues and so far they work fine . <p> I looked at a lot of online stuff , read some books and PDFs , and figured out it 's like everything else in this hobby , taking the first step is the hardest part . <p> It takes time to put in all the spikes , but once the first rail goes down the rest falls in line . Preparation is the key , making sure each piece of rail is cut , beveled , trimmed , before it gets spiked ( do n't ask how I found that out ! ) . The templates showing where to put things makes it easy . Placing the frog point in the precise location is a must , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used was my Dremel/bits , a file , spike pliers , gauge , straight edge , ruler , soldering iron for the frog points and throw bar , and head worn magnifier . I looked at the tools some places offer to make these easier , but add them up and you 're spending several hundred $$$ on specialty tools for a single use . Sure I have 17 more to do , but they 'll get easier , the 2nd was easier than the 1st and looks/performs much better IMO . <p> Commercial turnouts are anywhere from $75 up , I guesstimated 1 of these homemade turnouts cost under $25 , especially if you make the frog from rail like I did on the 2nd one . <p> A bit over 2 lengths of rail , bag of ties , spikes , and other bits ( like brass for the throw bar ) most modelers will have around their workbench . <p> The reasons I did this was : <p> 1 ) Wanted a longer mainline to run my passenger trains , hopefully we 'll see the GGD Silver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Wanted to see if my engines and rolling stock with hi-rail wheels would navigate thru 2-rail turnouts and track before I tore down my old layout and started expanding in 2-rail . I 'm 95% sure they will . Remember , I 'm running off battery power remote control , non-insulated wheels do n't affect that . I love not having any wiring ! ! ! <p> 3 ) Wanted a yard to store freight cars . <p> In order to do this I 'm in the process of clearing out 2/3 of the upstairs space . Once done then I can proceed with the new layout . <p> Oh I completely agree Bob , the first step is the hardest but as you said once you get started it just starts to flow and get easier as you go . You 'll figure out your own way of doing it , method or tricks ect that work for you and it will really fly . I always built off the frog , everything would just fall in to place for me that way , then I just built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the cost , I would agree the savings are huge especially if you have a bunch of turnouts ... the process goes much quicker than most think . That 's the thing with hand laid track , you can build it any way you want , going anywhere you want and depending on the time one wishes to invest in the effort one can do their entire layout or just certain areas ... I like that flexibility . Keep up the good work and post some pics when you are able to , I 'd love to follow the progress . 175854 @qwx375854 175853 @qwx375853 <h> Block 175862 @qwx375862 
@@36014901 @5014901/ <h> MTH DCS with TMCC/Legacy <p> I read the DCS companion book last night and it seems to focus on just using the MTH DCS hand held to operate both DCS and Legacy ( TMCC ) . <p> I actually prefer to just use both hand helds , Cab-2 for Lionel locos and the DCS hand held for MTH locos , instead of using the DCS hand held as a universal remote . <p> The article in the book actually said they can co-exist , so I am wondering if I even have to do anything to run both with each respective hand held , albiet making sure both the Legacy base and its one wire is attached to the track and that the TIU is attached to the track as well . <p> However , I am using a MTH Z-1000 Brick for my MTH DCS and a MTH Z-1000 Transformer for Legacy ( set to 18v ) , do I set up both for the same layout ? <p> I have two MTH Z-1000 bricks available , one Z-1000 transformer , and two TIUs. ( one is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything correct . DCS and Legacy operate fine together using their respective remotes just fine . My layout is powered by a modern ZW controller . One wire from the Legacy base added to the output common of the TIU or to the common of the layout . If you want to connect DCS and Legacy together use the required cable and follow Barry 's book . You can still use the respective remotes but can have access to the Legacy engines ( in TMCC mode ) via the DCS remote if you want . <p> Sound like you are doing everything correct . DCS and Legacy operate fine together using their respective remotes just fine . My layout is powered by a modern ZW controller . One wire from the Legacy base added to the output common of the TIU or to the common of the layout . If you want to connect DCS and Legacy together use the required cable and follow Barry 's book . You can still use the respective remotes but can have access to the Legacy engines ( in TMCC mode ) via the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to use 2 power sources make sure they are phased . <p> Marty , what do you mean by phased ? <p> I do not think I have to use 2 power supplies , I am just not sure how to power the track using both Legacy ( TMCC ) and DCS with one power supply/transformer . <p> I would rather not connect the TIU and Legacy together electrically or with the special cable . <p> Most modern transformers this is probably not going to be an issue as they have a polarized plug . Older transformers without the plug , could be plugged in that when one was putting out the positive half of the AC sine wave , a second transformer could be on the negative half of the cycle . If used on the same track in separate blocks this could create a potential of a high voltage across the block . This was usually solved by flipping the power cord in the outlet . This might help . <p> Since you listed modern transformers I would n't expect you to have any issues . And depending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> You can run DCS &amp; legacy engines on the same track so you just have to supply power to that track . The second power supply comes into play when you run out of power . Ex too much track , , , , too many engines ....... and if you 're maybe using separate loops . <p> Should not be a problem using an original " G " . The blacks are all common to each other . <p> Our layout is setup to run DCS and Legacy . They are independent of each other as we are NOT using the cable that connects the TIU to the Legacy base . We can run a DCS engine , and a TMCC/Legacy on the same loop , using the 2 remotes . <p> We could connect the 2 systems together with that cable , and that would allow us to run the trains with the DCS remote .... but we like to control the different engines separately with their respective remotes . <p> Depending on your need for power and layout size , you could use 1 power supply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't make a difference . What does make a difference as Marty said , be sure they are phased correctly if you use 2 or more power supplies . <p> The easiest way to do it with 1 transformer/brick is connect the Legacy wire to the common side of the transformer/brick , then run the transformer power through the TIU , on the Fixed 1 Channel . That will power the track and give you control with both systems independently . <p> If you run a jumper to Variable 1 Channel ( on the input side of the TIU from Fixed 1 to Var 1 ) , and use the Var 1 output , you can also run conventional using the DCS remote , IF YOU WANT . You just have to remember to swap back and forth using the DCS remote , whether you want fixed or variable voltage . <p> Now if you have separate loops and use multiple transformers/bricks , you could run conventional , DCS , and TMCC/Legacy . <p> I know it sounds complicated and confusing , but it 's actually very simple . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure it out , you can too . <p> The easiest way to do it with 1 transformer/brick is connect the Legacy wire to the common side of the transformer/brick , then run the transformer power through the TIU , on the Fixed 1 Channel . <p> I strongly suggest that , instead of sending the Legacy signal through the DCS signal generator , you connect the Legacy wire to the Black terminal of each channel output on which you might want to operate Legacy or TMCC engines . It ca n't do any good at all to send the Legacy signal through the TIU signal generators and it 's just as easy to connect the wire to the TIU channel outputs . <p> Further , be aware that the TIU channel Common lines are not connected internally in any TIUs except for the original , Rev. G , model . I suggest that you connect the wire to all Black terminal TIU channel outputs upon which you intend to operate Legacy or TMCC engines . <p> If I want to just use both remotes and do n't  care about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I just hook up both teh TIU and Legacy base directly to the track as normal and use each handheld for their respective brands ? <p> Our layout is setup to run DCS and Legacy . They are independent of each other as we are NOT using the cable that connects the TIU to the Legacy base . We can run a DCS engine , and a TMCC/Legacy on the same loop , using the 2 remotes . <p> If I want to just use both remotes and do n't  care about using the MTH remote on teh lionel engines , cant I just hook up both teh TIU and Legacy base directly to the track as normal and use each handheld for their respective brands ? <p> If I do n't  mind using both the Lionel and MTH remotes for their respective brands , I can just connect the TIU and the Legacy Command base to the track the way I always do , with no connection between the TIU and Legacy base , correct ? 175854 @qwx375854 175853 @qwx375853 <h> Block 175862 @qwx375862

The Ben Franklin in Delta , Co has a nice selection of Basswood . The Evergreen styrene I get at Hobby Hut in Grand Junction . The Plastruct I used to get at Caboose Hobbies in Denver , but now closed . Not to many Hobby Shops for Model Trains here on the Western Slope . <p> My track ballast is from Ant Hills . The ants here build these ant hills that can be 2 feet in diameter , around 6-8 inches in height . The ants do a superb job of sorting the coarse sand , ( small pebbles ) to size . I scoop up the sand into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kitchen strainer . When laying the ballast I use a pair of tweezers to pluck out pieces that are too large or do n't look right and other junk . Then ballast the track with white glue and water . <p> The Signals are scratchbuilt . Evergreen Styrene tube for the mast . The base is a 3/4 inch PVC pipe fitting . With a flat piece of Styrene to make a top for the base . The base is countersunk sunk into the 1/2 Celotex . The signal head are Radio Shack LEDs in Styrene tubes . Styrene scraps make up the signal target face and the head along with some model putty . I made one to look like a UP Darth Vader hood , the other to look like small hoods over each lamp . The platform is needle point mesh and wood . The ladder is Plaststruct and wire for the hand rail . Flat black paint for the signal head , and the ladder and mast painted with a mix of grey primer and aluminum spray paint . <p> Signals are activated by relays and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the roof of the station , under the benchwork in the last picture with the train at the station .

The first signal pictured below controls an industrial spur where the spur meets the Main Line . This is in Grand Junction , Colo <p> This signal below is located in Glenwood Springs , Colo where the Branch line from Carbondale approaches the Main Line . The track to Carbondale is gone and replaced by a bike path , but this signal and about 1000 feet of track remain . The main line switch has been removed . Not sure how much longer this lonely signal will remain . But she still stands watch , waiting for the next train that will never arrive . <p> Have you ever scratch build prr signal and can we see layout tour of your layout ? <p> Nice work on signals , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any PRR Signals . Wiring the head for a PRR signal would be quite a task . One would have to use the smaller yellow LEDs and with a minimum of 7 lamps , soldering and threading all those wires would scare me away . <p> And as far as a Layout tour , my layout is not very big . It is a Loop to Loop , and the pictures here show most of the large portion of my layout . <p> I am trying to post more pictures , But having a problem with Photobucket . I will try later to add more . <p> OK Think I solved the picture problem . Do n't have to use photobucket anymore . Wish I knew this before . <p> Here are more Signal Pictures <p> Below is a small Dwarf Signal I built and wired to the O42 manual switch .

I soldered a stiff piece of #16 wire to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scale rail joiner and soldered it to the end of the piece of wire making a ugly looking " T " The white is styrene scraps to act as an insulator . I made a bead of solder at the end of the red and green wires and glued them to the styrene . When the switch is thrown the T slides back and forth making the circuit from the yellow wire changes the signal from Green to Yellow ( the red wire is to the yellow lamp ) The base of the signal is a 3/4 in PVC pipe fitting . I cut it in half so it was n't too tall . Glue a scrap piece of styrene to make a top . I have one of the single hole paper punch tools . Just the right size to make a hole for the Mast . The under side of the base is a mass of Hot Glue to hold the mast in place . A larger piece of sheet styrene with a hole cut to fit the PVC fitting is glued to make a large flange . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the plywood and a 1/4 inch hole through the plywood for an extension of the mast to go through the plywood so the base is countersunk . The large sheet styrene flange sits on top of the Celotex , thumb tacks to hold in place . My other signals , the base is made the same as this dwarf signal . The wire I use is from 4 wire telephone cable . <p> Here is a searchlight signal . Same at the other signals . The mast is 1/4 Styrene tube . The target is a 1/4 steel washer . The Lamp hood is 5/16 tube with a Radio Shack Bi-Color LED . Target and Hood are painted with flat black spray paint . Mast and ladder painted with a mix of grey primer and aluminum spray paint . Lots of ACC glue , some model putty , sanding to make smooth , and a lot of time masking off the black and silver from each other to paint .

@@36014907 @5014907/ <h> Combined DCS/Legacy Wiring Diagrams <p> I 'm brand new to the OGR Forum and am just returning to the hobby ( 3-rail O ) after a 20 year hiatus . In that time along came DCS/Legacy and it 's amazing to me the leap forward in technology and scale detail from the last time I ran a train around my Dad 's ping pong table back in the early ' 90s ( I was 14 at the time ) . <p> Now that I have the time/space/$$$ I 'm re-educating myself in order to plan for a large-ish layout in what will be a finished basement . With that said , I 'm really struggling on the electrical side of things . I 'm fairly certain I want a dual Legacy/DCS ( which means MTH equipment , am I correct ? ) setup . My request is this : can anyone share wiring diagrams of their layouts ( or if they have a mock up of a simple one ) to show me how a typical , modern track is wired up that can support both Lionel Legacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordered The DCS O-Gauge Companion ( has n't arrived yet ) but I was n't sure if that would address the Lionel Legacy piece . I 'm a visual person , so looking through a wiring diagram or a layout would be very helpful and interesting . If anyone has any available , I 'd be grateful if I could take a look . One caveat : I do n't have RR Track software so it 'll have to be a . bmp or some type of picture or PDF file . <p> Also , if anyone has any links or suggestions for other reference material , I 'd appreciate it . <p> In short , just wire your layout for DCS as recommended , then you just connect one wire from the legacy base to a common on the layout . <p> Using this method , can you operate DCS and Legacy equipment at the same time ? Like I said , I 'm a novice on the electrical piece of this . I would have thought that having both wired directly to the layout would cause interference between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the same time ? Or is that handled with addresses for the engines ? Thanks again ! <p> You can run both at the same time . The signal protocols and method of broadcast are different so they do n't interfere with each other . <p> In fact , if you 're adept at juggling remotes , you could hitch a Lionel to an MTH and run both together with the two remotes .

@@36014909 @5014909/ <h> Wood side door cabooses of T&amp;P and AT&amp;SF <p> Just picked up a Hallmark Texas &amp; Pacific wood side door caboose in anticipation of the Sunset 3rd Rail T&amp;P 2-10-4 recently announced . A bit of internet research produced that these cabooses were built in 1928 in the TP Marshall , TX shops and were nicknamed " muleys " . Additionally the AT&amp;SF also had long lived wood side door cabooses , numbered in the 1000 series . I thought that side door cabooses were a late 19th century phenomenon and banned by the ICC for safety reasons in the early 20th century , as crew members occasionally stepped out the side door into on-coming trains . Were these cabooses allowed to operate only in the " Republic of Texas " , but banned elsewhere . Could any folks flesh out the history on these two cars and side door cabooses in general ? <p> John - Thank you for the comment . Believe , the IC cabooses have a " half door " , which I think is only for loading supplies , not usage by crew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That " side door " on the IC cabooses is crewmen to use when picking up orders/messages . That the person was safely INDIDE the caboose , instead of hanging off the cabooses steps , with only one hand holding on while the other arm was used to " hoop the orders " . That door had nothing to do with " loading supplies " . <p> The Pentrax IC video mentioned they were illegal in Iowa , but no explanation was given . Occasionally saw an Iowa Division caboose without the side door , but apparently they did n't venture east too often . <p> Rusty 175852 @qwx375852 <p> Rusty - Interesting . I was under the impression that they were banned by the Interstate Commerce Commission , but perhaps it was done state by state . There were railroad laws initiated by the individual states ...... NY required 5 man crews and when PRR trains hit the PA border , they dropped the " spare " man . Also CO required locomotives to carry water - hence the canvas bags hanging on D&amp;RGW tenders . 175852 @qwx375852 <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeming antique , but built after Texas &amp; Pacific took delivery of their 2-10-4 's !

Hallmark made several other , different , side door cabooses than these , but not in O , but HO .

It is safe to assume that any use of a side-door ATSF waycar on through freight ended when the first steel ones started showing up in the late 1920 's . They lasted on certain locals through and after World War II .

@@36014910 @5014910/ <h> Mike and Howard . Why not a Polar Express tinplate set ? <p> With the new release of the Lionel corporation catalog we see most of the same O and standard gauge trains in different colors and road names . That 's not a complaint and this thread is not intended to be whiny why ca n't you make something different thing . I certainly do n't know the terms of the MTH/Lionel tinplate agreement from 2009 but with the incredible popularity of the Polar Express and sales to match for Lionel it seems like a tinplate PE set would be a no brainer ! I 'm not talking about an over the top expensive set just a moderately priced RTR set in O gauge or Standard gauge or heck why not both ! A set like this might even generate an interest in tinplate to someone who has been on the fence to take a ride on the shiney side ! <p> I personaly think the PE colors would look drop dead gorgeous in tinplate ! Below is my kinda sorta idea of what I 'm talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't know if Lionel would want an O gauge tinplate set as it would ( even if done as a joint venture ) partially compete against their O gauge offerings , but I would love a tinplate standard gauge Polar Express , and it would n't compete against anything Lionel is currently making . They 've done O , G , S and soon HO , so why not do standard gauge before moving off to do N and Z ? <p> You did an amazing job with those cars . I think that the biggest obstruction would be the Warner Brothers Polar Express trademarking . The Lionel agreement may be exclusive . I 'm 99% sure that their agreement with Lionel would not extend to Lionel Corporation Tinplate ( MTH ) . You 're talking about two separate companies despite the similarity of the name . Lionel has extended this branding to G , O , and HO . <p> Very nicedly done , Chris . What paint did you use for the Polar Express blue ? Krylon 's satin burgandy is an excellent match for P.E @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ match for P.E . blue , so exactly what did you use for P.E . blue and where did you get it ? <p> Very nicedly done , Chris . What paint did you use for the Polar Express blue ? Krylon 's satin burgandy is an excellent match for P.E . red but I have yet to find an acceptable match for P.E . blue , so exactly what did you use for P.E . blue and where did you get it ? <p> Off the top of my head I do n't remember I did these a while ago but I 'll take a look . The blue is a bear to get close to an exeptible match but I did use the burgundy you mentioned . <p> It would depend on whether Lionel has the right to lend its license to LCT . I do n't know the terms of the license agreement . Commercially , Lionel would still earn the royalty from the tinplate set through the LCT license agreement and through any agreement to lend the PE license . So , it would make sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see the O gauge coaches first . I have some black engines I could pull them with . I would also buy the Standard gauge coaches . I prefer the Ives Transition Coaches like the Black Diamond ones . <p> I would also like to see the gold engine . That would be cool in tinplate ! <p> Absolutely agree . It 's been on my Standard Gauge wish-list since I joined the tinplate ranks a few years ago . We 've discussed this here on the forum several times , yet I forgot to ask Mike W about this when he visited Nicholas Smith Trains and upgraded my DCS a few months ago . My bad . <p> If I see Mike or Andy at the MTH booth next week at York , I 'm gon na inquire about this . We all should . Worst they can say is " No can do " . But let 's keep our hopes up ! ! !

I have been looking for years for that first set that really appeals to my idea of a tinplate train set . Brass or chrome trim , deep rich colors and that sheen on the paint . Now , hold on to your trouser , but I have a real problem with the paint color on the cars of all Lionel PEs . To me , ( my opinion ) those cars in the movie are a rich blue , not a pastel rose blue from the 70 's . Make the passengers cars a rich deep blue , nice wine burgundy accent with gold letters and trim pulled by a multi driver black engine ... and I 'm all in . <p> I totally agree w/ Chris 's Polar Exp LCT proposal . Like the recently released S and HO versions , a tinplate PE would also continue to extend the Polar Exp movie brand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a more appropriate 10 yr. anniversary offering than the O gauge diesel Ft ribbed passenger set . The FT set was a nice " modern " looking set with passenger car interiors that IMO resembled what a modern day excursion line might offer in the Polar Exp theme . <p> Hopefully Lionel , MTH and Warner Bros. /Castle Rock can come to an agreement to make a Polar Exp . LCT offering a reality . It certainly would be a win/win/win/win for each of the companies AND us . <p> I created my Polar Express ( I changed it to The Ryder Express , my grand sons name , and put pictures of his family in the windows . I also changed the trucks so he can run it with his post war engine ) with Lionel 610 &amp; 612 Tin Plate cars . I used the Krylon Burgandy &amp; Dupli-color G.M. Blue ...

Lionel did that with the Polar RR series .

Unfortunately , that topic of conversation lasted for all of about 10 seconds . Lionel 's exclusive licensing apparently is a sticking point that will likely keep this from EVER happening until different heads prevail at Lionel . It was certainly a let-down to hear this , because everybody knows ( including Mike who has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offering in tinplate would sell like hot-cakes . Unfortunately the suits at Lionel do n't want to loosen the strings on their current licensing agreement with Warner Brothers -- even if Mike were to include the offering under the existing LCT arrangement . <p> Perhaps another day , but I 'm not holding my breath after talking to Mike . As for producing a train with the P/E color-scheme without reference to " Polar Express " ... I suppose it 's worth asking him that question directly when you see him at York . But when Mike and I were talking briefly today , I understood him to say that he had already approached Lionel to do a Lionel Lines train ( ala LCT ) in Polar Express colors , and even that was denied . Apparently , the suits at Lionel get to sign off on anything MTH currently produces under the LCT licensing agreement using the Lionel name . Understandable , but also limiting . <p> I suppose we should be happy that there 's an agreement of any kind at all between MTH and Lionel to produce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mike say on other occasions that he would n't be producing as much of today 's tinplate line as he currently is doing were it not for the ability to use " Lionel Lines " on many of the products ... or under the banner of Lionel Corporation Tinplate or Lionel Electric Trains . Me personally ? I could give a hoot whether the Lionel name is on tinplate products . I got over Lionel being the be-all / end-all of toy trains YEARS ago when I realized that the Lionel of today bears absolutely no resemblance whatsoever to the Lionel of yesteryear . Today 's Lionel execs just happen to be moment-in-time honchos in what is admittedly a revolving door of players who have authority and ownership of the " Lionel brand " a few years at a time . So I 'm not particularly interested in paying one penny premium for ANY product just because it says " Lionel " somewhere on the product or on the box . But I respect Mike Wolf for doing what he does in this hobby with so much passion . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tinplate , then I trust him on that commentary . Unfortunately like many things in life , we take the bad with the good . <p> Hi David . Thanks for running it by him . At least we have some kind of reason even tho we may not agree with it ! Maybe you should ask him about the color ! Look at the 2017 catalog in the back . Check out the colors of the country station ! Look familiar ? <p> If the lawyers wo n't let that happen , how about offering items in kit form that are pre-primed and ready to be painted and assembled by the end user ? Basically the same as was done with the 700K back in the day . Any good auto paint shop could match the PE colors . This would not just be limited to Polar Express fans but any paint job a person desires . <p> I spoke with Mike Wolf at York today about a couple of items , and this time I did n't forget to ask him about an LCT Polar Express Train . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about 10 seconds . Lionel 's exclusive licensing apparently is a sticking point that will likely keep this from EVER happening until different heads prevail at Lionel . It was certainly a let-down to hear this , because everybody knows ( including Mike who has already approached Lionel with the idea ) that a P/E offering in tinplate would sell like hot-cakes . Unfortunately the suits at Lionel do n't want to loosen the strings on their current licensing agreement with Warner Brothers -- even if Mike were to include the offering under the existing LCT arrangement . <p> Perhaps another day , but I 'm not holding my breath after talking to Mike . As for producing a train with the P/E color-scheme without reference to " Polar Express " ... I suppose it 's worth asking him that question directly when you see him at York . But when Mike and I were talking briefly today , I understood him to say that he had already approached Lionel to do a Lionel Lines train ( ala LCT ) in Polar Express colors , and even that was denied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off on anything MTH currently produces under the LCT licensing agreement using the Lionel name . Understandable , but also limiting . <p> David <p> And what was Lionel 's response when you asked them about it ? Or did n't you ask ? I 'm just truly curious if there is more to it than the " suits at Lionel " not wanting to loosen the strings ? But if you did n't ask them I guess we just get half the story . Will you be at York tomorrow to ask . Maybe someone else ? <p> I 've always been surprised that they did n't make one especially since the train set running around the tree at the end of the movie is clearly supposed to be made of metal .

Mike R was surrounded by quite a crowd of enthusiasts , and I was only gon na be at York for a few hours on Thursday . Hopefully , somebody else may have asked . Did you ? <p> There could certainly be legal T 's &amp; C 's surrounding the arrangement with Warner Bros . Corporate lawyers are often known to get in the way of getting things done ! But I 'm just speculating here . Hopefully , we 'll get a full answer from both parties some day .

It has the same style of postwar switch machine except there is no fixed voltage input and the cover is die-cast instead of Bakelite . Of course , I ca n't be sure it is the original switch machine , but I suspect it is . I 'm wondering if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feature ? Maybe they used some leftover prewar switch machines for the oddball O22A switch in 1947 ? I have one O22A switch and it is just the same as an O22 except they were made without cover plates on the bottom , they lacked the fixed voltage input jack , and they say O22A on the I 'd plate . <p> I 'm curious about the prewar heritage of what I originally thought were postwar-design switches . If anyone has additional information to add , I will be interested to hear it . I 'm aware that Lionel made earlier versions of switches also designated O22 , which were a completely different design . <p> While we are on this subject , is there a way to differentiate prewar and postwar versions of the 1024 manual switches for O27 track ? I have two pairs of 1024 's , currently using some on a layout . One of their advantages is that the smaller baseplate permits some track arrangements not possible with other O27 switches . <p> This last photo shows the I 'd plate for a 1947-only O22A switch , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Another trivia question : when did Lionel start using the 5133 number on what otherwise looks like a O22 switch ?

My 721 switch ( second photo ) has plastic rails in that area . Both 711 and 721 have very heavy die-cast bases . The prewar 711 switch machine appears to be interchangeable with those used on the postwar O22 switches . <p> I 'm still hoping someone can explain the O22 switch with " automatically controlled " on the I 'd plate , as shown in first photo .

It is a long list of things to check and/or fix to make 022 switches reliable . I have done more than 100 switches , and if all the modifications/fixes are done , the switches are bulletproof . <p> One problem that is easy to fix when you do n't have power is the constant voltage plug-in area . With the plug removed the contact inside completes the power circuit for the switch to get power from middle rail of the track , so the little copper nail ( looks like a nail ) needs to make contact with the copper piece about an eighth of an inch wide by half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That is why a post war ZW or Z will work with the 022 switches from another terminal like the B or C terminal when the track has power from the A or D terminal .

Diodes are cheaper than lamps and I think the lanterns look better with the lamp at a lower voltage . I often run my switches from the 20 volt fixed output of a KW . <p> I use a blue crimp on lug for the fixed voltage plug . It is much cheaper than the Lionel plug and does n't tend to fall out and I can crimp wires directly to it . <p> I prefer to use older Lionel switches : postwar 022 switches with screw based lamp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When I am tuning up a switch , I look to have it work well at around 15 volts . <p> I have some that work well at 9 volts , and some require more voltage . I have not yet discovered the difference . <p> Recently I bought some 711 switches , and they seem to like more voltage than the post war 022s . I just checked the coil resistance on these switches and it is 8.6 ohms . The coil resistance of the 022s is 6.5-7 ohms . A ZW has a maximum output voltage of 20 volts and a Type V has a maximum output voltage of 25 volts which is in line with the coil resistances . <p> Two of the 711 switches that I have use large flat head screws rather than the 4-36 screws that new switches use . The coils I measured were on a switch motor that uses the flat head screws . <p> I recently made this post on another forum and got only one offline reply . I 'm incorporating that reply and cross-posting here in case 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My post exclusively deals with prewar Lionel 711 switches . <p> I have been buying these switches over a 10-year period for a large layout I 'm building . I need 29 of them and have managed to acquire a few more than that . <p> When I first started , I got a good deal on a batch of seven switches , and it was then that I discovered the different variations manufactured over the seven years these items were catalogued ( 1935-42 ) . There is not a lot of information on these switches in the reference materials I own , but I 'd like to list them here for others ' comments and corrections . <p> From the 40-odd switches that I now have and the 100 's of others I 've looked over , I believe these are the major variations . I am listing them in what I assume is chronological year of manufacture : <p> Variation 1 : -- Diecast switch motor cover , tin rails between the points and the frog , small frog , no fixed voltage plug , and *no* @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lionel 's O72 remote control switches did not have the non-derailing feature . Additionally , while the switch motors are interchangeable , installing a diecast cover on the later variations does not work as the two bottom screws of the cast cover are very different from the later screws . Most importantly , the earlier switches with their metal frogs frequently ripped-off the early slide shoes of the tinplate cars . The frog that exists on these switches is quite small . The center rails on the two turnouts do not flow into the rest of the switch and simply terminate with normal tubular O track pins protruding from the receiving rails . <p> Variation 2 -- Diecast switch motor cover , tin rails between the points and the frog , small frog , no fixed voltage plug , with the non-derailing feature . Other than the non-derailing feature , Variation 2 is similar to Variation 1 . <p> The picture posted above by Ace shows the earlier design : <p> Variation 3 -- Diecast switch motor cover , black rails between the points and the frog , larger frog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second frog design ( which seems to have lasted all the way through the rest of the run ) is a more thoughtful design and results in a tidier and better-performing switch . A similar arrangement for integrating the center rails on the turnouts with the main body of the switch was also deployed on the more familiar O22 switch , first cataloged in 1938 . <p> The second picture posted by Ace shows the later frog design : <p> Variation 4 -- Diecast switch motor cover , black rails between the points and the frog , larger frog , WITH fixed voltage plug , with non-derailing . A hole appears on the side of the diecast switch motor cover to allow the insertion of a 711-151 fixed voltage plug . Candidly , I do n't know when the fixed voltage plug first became available because I have seen 711s with a diecast cover both with and without fixed voltage plugs *and* both with and without the larger frog/integrated center rails . My assumption is that switch motors were swapped over the years by previous owners . <p> Variation 5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have a number of 711s -- over half -- with a black bakelite switch motor cover , black rails between the points and the frog , larger frog , with a fixed voltage plug , with non-derailing . The reference books I have read indicate that only diecast switch motor covers were made before the war , but the bakelite ones that I have do not look altered in any way . This includes a few that I purchased with the original boxes and packing materials . I am anxious to hear others ' thoughts . <p> Those are the 711 variations I have observed plus one provided to me offline . Did I miss any ? Does Variation #5 exist , or was it simply created by previous owners replacing the covers and/or switch motors with their postwar equivalents ? <p> Check my post " 022/711 switch operating pblms " Search for it using Google . It is a long list of things to check and/or fix to make 022 switches reliable . I have done more than 100 switches , and if all the modifications/fixes are done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why do n't you simply edit your original post or add a new one with a link to the post you are referring to ? <p> The later 711 switches had the same motor as the early 022 switches . These motors had bakelite covers and constant voltage pluts and non-derailing with the non-derailing rail segments at the end near the frogs and they need two insulating pins . <p> The early 022 switch motors used a plastic slider for the sliding contacts and to move the points . The later switch motors use a metal slider . The plastic slider does n't always work correctly as it will sometimes bounce when it hits a stop . Lionel put a plug in the end of the solenoid to try to damp the bounce , but frankly it did n't always work well . The metal sliders do n't bounce . My preference is to change the switch motors to 022 motors with the metal slider . <p> The early switch motors have a problem with the design of the sliding contacts . The contact area is much too large and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are difficult to adjust and are fouled easily with oil or dirt . I have some of these and they have been a bit of a challenge . <p> Any of the motors that do not have a constant voltage plug can be modified for constant voltage operation by bring two wires out of the switch motor with space lugs so that they can either be connected together ( power from the track ) or one can be connected to constant voltage from the transformer . <p> I have converted some 721 ( manual ) switches to electric operation . I used a 022 switch motor and wired the rail segments to the switch motor . I had to insulate the rail segments . One end was insulated , the other was not . <p> I recently bought a bunch of Lionel 022 and 5132/33 switches . The 5132/33 have mainly SCREW base bulbs and the 022 's have MAINLY Bayonet bases.But , since the motors are separate from the switches perhaps some of mine have had the motors switched . <p> IMHO , the bayonet base bulbs are better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I recommend bending the socket for screw in bulbs enough to make friction so the bulbs do n't come loose . I bought some 022 switches some years ago that had the bulbs glued in . Not a good idea . Of course , if you put a diode in series with the light bulb , the life of the bulb becomes almost infinite , so gluing might not create any problems . <p> The comments of servoguy along with the posting from Serenska are interesting when put side by side , <p> I have 12ea 711 switches that would be classified as a Variation 4 . All the switch bases have mounting lugs threaded for 8x32 screws to mount the switch motors . The diecast covers are also tapped for 8x32 screws .. All my switch motors have the plastic sliding contact and base plates obviously have the large screw holes . <p> Since it was stated that the same motor was used on the later 711 switches and the 022 switches , did the mounting lugs on the later 711 switch bases change to handle the smaller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ switches that would be associated with the Bakelite covers ? Are there different sized mounting holes in the covers ? . <p> Some people drink from the fountain of knowledge . Others just gargle. " -- Robert Anthony <p> Could I jump in here with a suggestion and a question . As to using LEDs on the 022 switches , the LED direct-replacement lamps are quite expensive ( like $2-$4 a piece ) . You can buy 12V bayonet or screw-type LEDs on ebay for about $5 for 20 ( or less ) . Then you get a 12VDC walwart from ebay for power and do the following . Remove the plastic cover so you can see the constant voltage terminal . Follow the wire from the bulb socket to that terminal and unsolder it from that terminal . Solder a wire to the end of the wire that was on the terminal , insulate the joint , route the wire out of the space around the constant voltage pin , and then replace the cover . Now replace the incandescent with a DC LED . Connect the ground side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U ( ground ) terminal and the + side of the power supply to the new wire coming out of the switch . This will save lots of $$ if you have many switches ( as I do ) in your layout . <p> My question is regarding the 5132 &amp; 5133 switches . I just bought one on ebay , and it arrived with no screws holding the rail assembly to the control assembly . I have some spare 022 parts ( and screws for that attachment ) but they are not compatible . Could someone tell me what those screws are . <p> IMHO , the bayonet base bulbs are better because they do n't get loose . In my thread , I recommend bending the socket for screw in bulbs enough to make friction so the bulbs do n't come loose . I bought some 022 switches some years ago that had the bulbs glued in . Not a good idea . Of course , if you put a diode in series with the light bulb , the life of the bulb becomes almost infinite , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of clear nail polish near the top of the threads will keep the bulb from working loose . 175854 @qwx375854 175853 @qwx375853 <h> Block 175862 @qwx375862

@@36014925 @5014925/ <p> Little more than three miles separates Brooklyn from New Jersey across Upper New York Bay . By freight train , however , the trip between the two can cover 280 miles and take more than 24 hours . <p> That is because in recent years virtually all rail traffic between Brooklyn , Queens and Long Island , at one end , and points south , at the other , has traveled over the ' ' Selkirk Hurdle , ' ' a 280-mile loop that extends up the east shore of the Hudson River to a bridge at Selkirk , N.Y. , near Albany , then down the west side of the river . <p> That story from 30 years ago - and the same problem exists today ! <p> The Poughkeepsie railroad bridge has been out of service since 1974 and cross-harbor rail ferry service is rather limited . <p> A cross-harbor tunnel for rail freight has been proposed , at tremendous expense . The existing commuter railroads have marginal capacity for freight services . <p> The NH and PRR moved 100 car freight trains across New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Car floats would probably be more cost effective than a tunnel . A tunnel would probably need to be funded by tax payers . The NH ran most freights at night when passenger traffic was low . <p> Years ago the PRR test ran a few freights to the NH via Penn Station tunnels / Hell Gate bridge . While it worked I understand the tunnel grades resulted in rough handling which created some broken drawbars . Below are links that go into more detail on this : <p> As for the Poughkeepsie bridge freight had to be routed via Maybrook , NY which is also somewhat circuitous but not as long as going up to Selkirk . There was no direct connection to NYC 's West Shore Line at the bridge which is understandable when one sees the height difference between the two lines . While the Poughkeepsie bridge was a good method to get freight across the Hudson by rail it reduced Penn Central 's portion of a freight move which resulted in less revenue cut to the PC . When the bridge burned PC decided to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at that time . <p> In August 1974 , the Penn Central applied for $1.75 million to repair and improve the bridge from the federal government through the Regional Rail Reorganization Act of 1973. 16 By 1975 , efforts had shifted to acquiring a combination of state and railroad funding . In November 1975 , a formal agreement between the New York State Department of Transportation and the trustees of the Penn Central was approved , allowing the $359,000 insurance payout for the bridge to be spent on repairs , with the state paying the rest ... on April 1 , 1976 , ownership of the bridge changed with the inception of Conrail. 18 Having been forced to include the route over the bridge ( the Maybrook Line ) in its new system at the behest of Connecticut Senator Abraham Ribicoff , Conrail announced that it would not promise to repair and use the bridge despite a Connecticut foundation 's offer to pay half the repair cost if the bridge were used again . The railroad further said that other work required to make the route usable would raise the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... <p> ... and to sum up , the bridge was falling apart and Conrail basically gave it away to avoid further liability .

The reason is the engine is NOT on its default , out-of-the-box address .

@@36014934 @5014934/ <p> Let me try to be more exact . . . if I 'm running Fastrack 0-36 curves and I want to buy my first MTH train . . . let 's say a 20-20225. . . there are two flavors , -1 or -2 . Scale wheels or Hi Rail . Both models say they run on 0-31 curves . What 's the difference ? Why would I want one over the other ? <p> the mth engine with the last number -1 is for three rail . and will run on three rail track down to the curve it says on the box . most 20- premier diesels will run on a O-42 curve . <p> the mth engine with the last number -2 is for two rail . IF YOU CHANGE OUT THE scale wheels for the hi-rail wheels it will run on three rail track . BUT YOU NEED TO REMEMBER that the fixed pilot needs a O-72 curve for three rail track because you still will be using kadee couplers . <p> The term " Hi-Rail " simply means that everything associated with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is 3 rail and the profile of the track is higher than it would be if it where scale , therefore the term " Hi-Rail " . As far as rolling stock all hi-rail equipment should work well together , the only issues is when you start modifying stuff as mentioned above . As far as description , as long as it says 3 rail you should be ok . <p> You are confusing " Hi-Rail " with " height " . The Hi-Rail wheel models are for operation on 3-Rail , O gauge track ( AC power center rail ) . The 2-Rail Scale versions are for operation on 2-Rail Scale track DC power ) . The Hi-Rail models have the standard " lobster claw " couplers and will couple up with all you other 3-Rail pieces of rolling stock . <p> hi-rail version the coupler and pilot will swing with the curve just like the above pictures . <p> scale wheel version the coupler is a kadee mounted to the FIXED pilot , which does not move with the curve . so with the coupler BODY mounted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cars not to derail . <p> as hot water said above , O-31 , O-36 , O-42 , O-45 , O-48 , O-54 , O-63 , O-72 is just that in 3 rail track . <p> do not confuse curve with radius . if it says 36 radius on the box , times that by 2 . <p> 36x2= 72 radius circle for that engine . <p> so if you buy a scale wheel engine and replace them with hi-rail wheels , you can run that engine on three rail track . but you still have the fixed pilot with a body mounted kadee coupler , you will still need to run the engine on a O-72 curve . <p> alot of people are building 3 rail scale layouts now , they want the look of two rail with the close body mounted kadee couplers and scale wheels on 3 rail track . <p> To put it simply , MTH usually lists 2 minimum curves . If the number starts with an " O " like O-31 , O-36 , O-42 , O-54 , O-72 , etc ... That is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " -1 " version . 3 Rail track is labeled by its diameter so O-36 = 36in diameter . The other number you may see will be listed in inches such as 31 " r or 40 " r which is the radius ( half of the diameter ) of the required curve . This applies to the " -2 " Scale wheel engines on 2 Rail or 3Rail track . So if you want a " -2 " engine that has a 40 " r requirement and you want to run it on 3 rail track you would need O-80 curves . Make sense ? <p> To keep it simpler , you should get a -1 . I purchased an MTH -2 years ago and even with Atlas 0-108 the engine would not negotiate the curves . After laying 2 rail track for part of my layout with what would be 0-144 , I finally got the engine to run .

The wheels of a high rail engine are the same diameter as a scale engine , but the flanges are larger to accommodate what is needed to operate on 3 rail track . <p> The two engines closest are HiRail ( large 3 rail flanges ) , the engine furthest back is an MTH -2 on 2 rail track . <p> If you click on the picture you might just be able to compare the engine ( pilot ) truck flanges on the engines and you will see that the flanges on the -2 are not as large . <p> I think originally the use of the term Hi-Rail was used to describe a highly detailed and sceniced 3-rail layout and less to do taking 3 rail equipment and trying to make it as scale oriented as possible .

@@36014935 @5014935/ <h> Lionel Plug N Play <p> Does anyone know if these accessories are going to be able to be wired normally without cutting off the end of the cord ? If you have several accessories on your layout , you certainly do n't want to connect them all to the track . Also , with the power supply Lionel is including with the Lionchief sets , I 'm not sure you could run an accessory and a train at the same time . <p> -Michael R. <p> TCA 10-65677 <p> Even if you 're on the right track , you 'll get run over if you just sit there . <p> They showed a cable with no connector on one end in the catalog . I took it as the plug end going to the accessory and bare end to transformer or other power supply of your choice .

A remote that would handle multiple accessories . <p> This really does n't simplify installation for the average person . To many components . <p> I was disappointed to see these after hearing about accessories being featured in the upcoming Part 2 catalog . I have a PW-style layout with lots of the classic accessories and use old school activation methods . <p> Still , I imagine these will find an audience with those looking for -- well -- plug and play ability . <p> I 'm not sure if you have followed me on the EIU Forum ?

In the days of remote and iPad control . Really , a standardized circuit board can be used to achieve full accessories control via RF , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buys nothing on the ease of installation level for a newbie .. <p> That is correct . Plug and Play accessories are identical to Non plug and play ones except they have a cable and plug that plugs directly into the special track . Makes it nice and easy for new users . But every plug and play accessory includes a pigtail that has a female plug on one end and bare wires on the other . You plug your cable from your accessory into that pigtail . So if you want to hook it up the same way you have been for the last 50 years you can . It just adds a simplified connections method for new users not familiar with wiring or Christmas tree layouts , etc , but does not take anything away from wiring it the conventional way . There is no wire cutting of anything . Actually its a more solid connection than those spring clips they use on the bottom of a lot of accessories . <p> Sean 175852 @qwx375852 <p> I have the double floodlight towers that are plug in play . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wired them in with my other accessories . It takes a few minutes as the connection on the bottom of the floodlight tower is a nut and bolt arrangement . <p> I am a newbie to the forum but am considering PnP mainly for Hero Boys house for Christmas layout . So if I have an extra 36w lionchief power terminal , can I buy the pNP track and just hook it to the lionchief terminal track and that can be my power source without tapping the accessory line in my CW80 ? <p> The wires are just jacketed going up to the connector . So it is easy to just clip off the connector and have your two power wires . <p> The accessories come with the connector that has two leads for traditional wiring . The PnP system is intended for people who like to setup the annual Christmas layout , or get out their trains every now and then and use them on the carpet , etc . So the current product still meets the needs for both the traditional wiring folk as well as newcomers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a permanent layout . <p> In response to Panther 's comment - you could unsolder the leads from the wire inside of the accessory , then run the wire through your bench-work and resolder the wires to the accessory again . This would keep you from having to drill large holes to accept the connectors . But my assumption is that if you 're going to go through all this just to wire in an accessory , then it would be better to just wire the accessory in a traditional manner . <p> I do not see that Lionel has left anyone in the dust with the new connector system . And the accessories do not have to be run to track power only . 6-82406 can be run to a transformer and then this can be used to power three PnP accessories without requiring use of track voltage . This will also require the use of a pigtail connector or you can just clip the wires . <p> This all seems easy to me . Wondering where the confusion and/or animosity is rising from . <p> Looks to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constant voltage on the track . Folks with Lion Chief sets having only that puny little wall-wart are going to need a bigger power supply if they want to hook up more than one accessory , as are those who wish to run more than one LC locomotive at a time . <p> I believe you 're right Pete . However , I would think that a CW-80 might be enough for most carpet set-ups since many of the accessories are only operated one at a time and it 's usually when the train is not moving . <p> I like the intent of the PnP system . The execution seems just a little " overcooked " with the expensive proprietary connections , etc. but I 'm trying to view it from the new hobbyist 's point of view . Those who do n't have a basement full of tubular track , traditional accessories and large , multi-tap xformers to run them all . <p> Looks to me like plug and play was devised for layouts having constant voltage on the track . Folks with Lion Chief sets having only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power supply if they want to hook up more than one accessory , as are those who wish to run more than one LC locomotive at a time . <p> Pete <p> You are 100% correct . They are trying to appeal to a new , hopefully growing , crowd as opposed to the old , probably shrinking , crowd . <p> Yes , anyone looking to run more than one locomotive and/or one accessory will have to get a better power supply . Lionel sells a larger supply in the form of their 72-Watt Lionchief Wall Pack at a reasonable price . <p> Starter sets did not come with ZW transformers back in the day . They came with the minimum required to make the train go around the loop . <p> In response to Panther 's comment - you could unsolder the leads from the wire inside of the accessory , then run the wire through your bench-work and resolder the wires to the accessory again . This would keep you from having to drill large holes to accept the connectors . But my assumption is that if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wire in an accessory , then it would be better to just wire the accessory in a traditional manner . <p> I agree . It comes with an adapter as well . I was just trying to keep the wires in place and hold true to the plug-n-play feature . I move items around all the time on my layout so having the plug-in-play option was nice . I also do a lot of trading items and that was another reason to avoid cutting the wire . I only drilled the hole for one of the accessories . <p> I believe Lionel has now gone to a larger power pack for it 's Lion Chief sets , 54 watt ( 3 amp ) , instead of the smaller ones they had in the sets originally . I think they also sell adapters to go to regular wire connections for the Plug-N-Play items . <p> Hi folks . I just purchased a Lionel 6-82874 Early Intermodal Work House With Sounds . It 's plug and play equipped . I concur about the necessary large hole to accommodate making the wiring disappear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hate to get out the 3/4 inch bit and start mauling my plywood . Given that , here 's a few questions . First have any of you ever just cut the connector off and wired the accessory ( black and red wire only ) directly to the transformer ? Second , just ranting and I 'm sure no one knows the answer , but why does this particular accessory not come with an on/off feature ? I ca n't imagine given all the sound producing equipment we all have that at some point you wo n't want silence .

It 's always a good idea to be specific about which item(s) you have when discussing a problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You will quickly get concise replies . <p> Letting us know exactly what you have is a must , pictures , age and/or numbers help too . List these and then the possibilities about what can be done with it will flow . But all sounds right so far . Placing the Acc. track may require some test and tune . Remember the wheels are your switches for isolated rails , so move it where it turns on when needed . Extending and/or creating your own isolated tracks is n't hard , ( use OGF search , find threads ) When buying do n't be afraid to do some research , and ask some questions here first . Here 's some common carp or ... well let 's just see what floats , and what sticks ... Make sure items are for AC voltage and can handle 18v-20v peaks without damage ( to 24v for pre war transformers ) . Most Lionel items will be fine +90% of the time , but even some of the 1970s-80s Lionel items used DC voltage . Do n't use any DC items with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) to change AC to DC . With a rectifier and a small regulator ( or just a wall wart ) power to battery operated goodies can be supplied . LED lights use DCV , regular light bulbs do n't care and can use acv(ac) or dcv(dc) . Depending on the accessory you may want to check into using what I bet is the most popular little orangey red button of all time , The Lionel #90 . ( I 'd hold out for one with the " L " on the button ) <p> A Lionel loco will run either way its wired to the " variable posts " , but ... a quick way to tell if your wires are correct is blow the whistle/horn if you have one . If it does n't work , or if loco is bell equipped and you hold whistle/horn two seconds but the bell rings , you need to reverse the leads . ( or if the bell button blows the horn , switch the leads ) . Because its transformer AC , your track does n't really have a " positive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Those positions kind of change as the AC goes from positive to negative and back 60 times in a second ( 60hz ) The " variable " power legs should always go to the center(middle) rail and the " common(s) " goes to the 2 outside rails . Black is " common " on your CW-80 . Common to both fixed and variable circuits , because the two black posts are connected inside . I suppose you could call the non-common(red) fixed voltage " constant " , or maybe " hot " . We get " lazy " and refer to " common " as " ground " and use other " slightly incorrect " terms often . Equipment changes the lingo too . Just keep that in mind and do n't be afraid to ask . Some other transformers in the past ( post war era or " PW " &amp;nbsp used a variable common so if using ( and phasing ) two old transformers together , one may lose use of a whistle control , but might gain a bell control . Ie the U post ( " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and might , or might not be " variable " . Old PW whistles often need a 5volt boost to start well too . This boost was present in much old equipment , but the boost is not available in many modern transformers . The horn/whistle/bell relays old and modern are activated by a 1.5 volt dc current sent right along side the ac track power . Its a " positive dc offset " for whistles/horns . If you saw the just ac power as waves like on a oscilloscope , the peaks ( +pos. ) and valleys(-neg) would be equal distances from zero . If peaks are farther from zero(middle) than valleys that 's a " positive offset " . If the " valleys " are deeper from zero/center than the " peaks " are tall , it is a " negative offset " so the bell rings instead , if your loco even has one . Not all transformers , or trains have whistles/horns ( or smoke ) . Even less of both have had a bell . <p> This forum is a great place to get information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . However , if you are just starting out the best thing you can do is get a good book on wiring your train and layout items . This may not answer all your questions , but will give you a good understanding of how it all goes together . Here is one that helped me out a couple years ago . I had another book prior to this , but for me this one was more informative , easier to understand , and easier to read . It 's also for 3 rail AC O gauge trains , which is a little different ( also a bit easier ) than the 2 rail wiring for DC . Good to know about 2 rail and DC also , but you can get to that later . <p> Your local hobby shop ( if you have one ) may also have it and is another good place to ask questions about your purchases .

For conventional you can use all 4 channels with caveats . The variable channels can be controlled via the handheld . The fixed channels can be controlled via the handheld by using a Z-4000 with a side receiver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using the throttles on any transformers you would need 4 throttles . All 4 TIU channels would be set to fixed . <p> When doing this the TIU must be powered via the AUX power port instead of fixed 1 . This is what I do on one layout even though I have 2 Z-4000s powering the 4 TIU channels . Conventional and throttles go together for me . <p> Running conventional and command on the same track at the same time is difficult because most conventional engines fly at command voltages . Running TMCC and DCS on the same track at the same time can be done easily . <p> Thanks for the fast responses . Barry , if I am understanding you correctly , the pair of wires going to the fixed terminals are powering the TIU and the wires to the variable are controlling the engines . Changing the setting between fixed and variable will change how voltage is applied to the variable channel . <p> With this type of setup , will the amperage being drawn by the engines be going through the variable channel regardless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will only have the draw to power the TIU ? <p> Changing the setting between fixed and variable takes the TR button on the handheld out the the equation . In fixed mode the same power that goes into the variable channel comes out . In variable mode the output to the track from a variable channel is controlled via the handheld using the TR button . <p> The variable channel should be set to fixed in 2 situations . When running command engines through a variable channel . When controlling a conventional engine via the throttle of the input transformer . If not set to fixed the TR button needs to be used to put power to the track . <p> With this type of setup , will the amperage being drawn by the engines be going through the variable channel regardless of DCS or conv. being run ? The fixed terminal will only have the draw to power the TIU ? <p> Amperage through the Variable channel is a function of what 's on the tracks drawing amps . <p> CNJ , it is not necessary that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . DCS just runs just fine on the variable . On my layout , which has two TIU 's , I use two fixed circuits fed by a Z4000 which has the remote receiver so I can control the Z4000 output voltage from the DCS remote &amp; do n't need to use the handles , and four variable circuits . Any locomotive can run at any location on the layout at any time , be conventional or DCS . <p> if I want to run DCS , I simply set the variable channel for a voltage output adequate to run the trains , or , as Barry noted above , set them to fixed . <p> I can run both DCS and conventional on the same track at the same time , so long as I have the conventional train heavier than the DCS train , but once you get used to DCS , you 'll find that 's not fun . <p> I get ya , but he will not be able to run conventional and P2 at the same time , on the same track that way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it 's a bit of a pain ... Use the TR button on var channel to run conventional . To run ps -2 on the same var channel just press ENG .. you can switch back and forth between TR and ENG .... But why ? ? ? <p> Because I have an original Conventional 263E Lionel and a P2 MTH 263E that I like to control on the same track at the same time from the DCS hand held remote . <p> It was my dream as a child to be able to run in this manner , and now it can actually be done .

I was more concerned with wiring the TIU in a way to be able to run both without moving/switching wires to do so.Tim C <p> I belive Tim stated in his 1st post that he would NOT be running DCS/TMCC and Conventional at the same time . Why add confusion ? Toggle between Fixed and Variable with the DCS remote to run 1 mode at a time as you choose . <p> . Yes you could toggle between FXD and VAR using Menu/System /dcs set up/ every time you wanted to switch modes but you could also just leave the var set to var mode , When you want to run command , scroll up the voltage to around 20 volts and select engine using the ENG key . Pretty easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scroll the voltage back down . Either way works . <p> Or you could just leave it set to Fixed and when you want to run conventionally , just press TR , select the track and move the thumbwheel . That will put it back into variable until the DCS is powered off and then back on . <p> Or you could just leave it set to Fixed and when you want to run conventionally , just press TR , select the track and move the thumbwheel . That will put it back into variable until the DCS is powered off and then back on . <p> Yes , but would n't that put a high starting voltage on the track , not good for conventional . I think I 'd rather scroll up from 0 volts ( var mode ) rather than down from 20 volts . ( fxd ) <p> If you set the variable channels to fixed , are you saying they come up at 0 volts when you turn on the TIU ? What did I do wrong , mine came up live ? <p> They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inputs . <p> My expectation for someone who is only running conventionaly sometimes and command at others , is that all conventional engines would be either on toggled sidings or off the layout altogether until it 's time to operate conventionally . <p> In this case , I 'd first press TR , select the track and click voltage to 0 . Only then would I place conventional engines in service . <p> I have my variables set to fixed , &amp; fed from postwar ZW 's set at about 18 volts . When I turn on the power to the layout , the tracks on those circuits immediately ( 1-2 seconds ) come alive at 18 volts , without my doing anything . If they were being fed from a Z4000 , power would of course not come out of the transformer until further action were taken . <p> Any voltage going into a fixed channel comes directly out . A variable channel set in fixed mode does the same thing . <p> When a variable channel is set as variable no voltage comes out at power up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the screen will show the last voltage from the handheld power down . The first movement of the thumb wheel will put voltage on the track 1 volt higher or lower than said amount . If the track was set at zero the first move of the thumb wheel will bring up minimum voltage setting . <p> The fatal flaw of running command and then switching to conventional is start up voltage . Here is the scenario . You run command with the voltage set at 18v power everything down . Next session you put a Kline conventional engine on the track or a engine locked in forward or reverse . Hit the TR button , go to desired track . The voltage says 18v because that is the setting when you powered down . Still no voltage on the tracks . As soon as you move that thumb wheel big voltage is going to the track . That engine is now flying while you are spinning that thumb wheel down . <p> FYI most K-Line engines start in FWD for a F-N-R-N cycle . Other units cycle N-F-N-R . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the DCS signal off unless you desire to run a command engine in conventional mode . <p> Still no voltage on the tracks . As soon as you move that thumb wheel big voltage is going to the track .

@@36014940 @5014940/ <p> No . DCC and DCS can not co-exist on the same track at the same time . DCC takes DC current ( 10 to 24 volts depending on scale ) and rapidly switches the polarity back and forth . This creates an unusual form of modulated frequency AC current . This type of current pretty much wipes out any other communications signal on the rail . If you want to run both MTH and non-MTH DCC engines on the same track at the same time you need to do it with DCC . If you 're considering purchasing a DCC system I recommend NCE . <p> The main advantage to DCC is that it easy for people to understand how to debug communications problems . If you have good electrical continuity you will also have good signal continuity . The down side is that it has very limited bandwidth , communication is one-way , and there is no backwards compatibility with older conventional engines ( AC or DC ) . <p> The lack of backwards compatibility was a deal breaker for Lionel when they began working on TMCC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ O-gauge market would ever accept a command control system that would n't play nice with 100 years worth of existing engines . <p> Originally posted by Dave Allen:Dave , if you put a DCC equipped loco on a conventional track , will it run in conventional ? <p> Most DCC decodes now days are " dual mode " decoders . That means they will operate on either DCC or conventional DC . A lot of early DCC decoders would not operate on DC at all . A common complaint about DCC decoders equipped with sound is that the voltage range for speed control is compressed . Most sound decoders ( including PS3 's ) wo n't start moving until track voltage reaches 5 to 7 volts ( depending on manufacturer ) when the sound system gets enough voltage to start operating . For HO operators with wimpy power supplies that can only reach 12 volts under load that means you do n't have a lot of room to adjust between barely moving and full speed . MTH took a slightly different approach by using track voltage as a speed command @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engine only moves at 20 smph at 12 volts . However , at the NMRA HO standard maximum voltage of 15.5 VDC a PS3 engine runs at 75+ smph . For most O scale conventional DC operators the PS3 conventional speed curve should be a good fit . <p> Thanks Dave , DCC is a whole new minefield to me , but I 'm going to use it in some applications , like Darstaed locos , which only draw 0.5 amp , and only have headlights . So , a very cheap decoder should be fine . I 'm going to give the Bachmann ones a go . <p> Yes . DCC just does n't play nice with any other form of command of conventional control . If the DCC power signal is on the rails all engines need to have a DCC decoder . PS3 engines have a DCC decoder built in but PS2 do not . <p> Originally posted by Dave Allen:Thanks Dave , DCC is a whole new minefield to me , but I 'm going to use it in some applications , like Darstaed locos , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

I like the Tsunami sound/Engine decoders but they cost a bit . If your doing the install yourself for the first time , Take your time and continually test with a volt meter thru out the install to make sure everything stays isolated . <p> If you can get thru your first install/programming session without cussing , saint hood for you is just around the corner but if your like the rest of us just make sure the wife did n't invite the priest over for coffee while your programming in your first engine . <p> You 'll save on haircuts though you 'll pull it all out so you wo n't need to go Good LuckDavid <p> A TIU allows you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It would be curious if MTH could , with only software changes or perhaps minor TIU modification , provide some DCC capability on one TIU output . Since the newer PS3 engines have DCC and DCS capability , it might be a way to transition DCC users to DCS .

Though the points are better than they used to be , they 're nowhere near the fit and finish of Ross turnouts . <p> Ross turnouts are hand crafted from Gargraves-compatible rail glued and spiked to the ties , use gargraves pins , have stringers running in the ties to keep everything laser-straight , and come in a variety of sizes and styles not available from any other O gauge manufacturer . I like the the standard 11-degree turnout ( #5 ) as it is a good size , allows good mainline spacing on crossovers , and is precise enough to support scale-wheeled equipment . <p> Trust me ( and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth the extra money .

I have some 66 switches on the layout , so the complete changeover will take some time , but as of now , I have n't an exact count but I would guess that there are only 15 to 20 GG switches left . <p> The other thing that Ross offers is much more variety of switches . Steve has switches on curves of many different radius combinations , 3 way , 4 way and 5 way switches plus both double crossovers , double slip switches and more and some of these with different switch lengths . Gargraves track is and always will be a great track system to use , whether you use fixed diameter " snap track " sections or actually bend your own curves .

I know , cars can be added as I want but just wanted some comments fron the experts and rookies on the forum . <p> In the 70 's in Alaska , the ARR would spot the passenger cars at the bar . They would switch out the barge in Whittier . Whenever they got done they would back the freight to pick up the coaches . Sometime in the mid 70 's , the ARR started a seperate train for Whittier &amp; had a regular schedule . <p> Over in Durango , I have rode three photo specials and each one had the freight in front followed by the coaches .

So that 's how I run my mixed . <p> The Virginia Creeper was a daily mixed consist that served Abgingdon , Va . It was headed up with whatever local freight was on the schedule , followed by a baggage or combine and a heavyweight passenger car bringing up the rear . Heat came from a good old pot belly stove .

Freight was the money maker , the passenger cars were community service . <p> Gerry , Those are 2 intresting pictures . Considering it is in Alaska makes it understandable to have a train with this make up . I am sure the Alaska RR PROBABLY DOES WHAT EVER IT HAS TO .

The passenger cars would typically be left at a nearby station while the freight cars were switched out . In cold weather a passenger car would need to have an oil or coal stove to provide heat , and IIRC would also have batteries and an axle driven generator to provide lighting .

This was a test for looks as this will become my CP Holiday Train . Along with all the lights , what attracts me to the real Holiday Train is the mix of freight and passenger cars . This would not look correct for many roads though . <p> Another train I run mixed is a C&amp;O RDC set with a REA boxcar and two C&amp;O trailers on roadrailers . That idea came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks neat with the RDCs. 175852 @qwx375852 <p> Rusty , your idea of a mixed train is very much like mine . I think that is the traditional look . <p> Mixed trains were usually used on low-traffic branches to satisfy the usually very light need for passenger accomodation . Probably some FRA rule involved to support " public good " . So the accomodation was often the lowest quality the RR had to offer , ie using old cars and of course a slow schedule . <p> The narrow gauge RRs did a lot of mixed . and I read that on the EBT , the coal trains often ran with a combine or coach on the rear instead of a caboose. the crew found that the passenger car rode a lot better and preferred one . <p> Today , I do n't know that many mixed trains still exist . the recent issue of Railroad and Railfan magazine mentions one in Canada that they chased this past summer . also in Canada , the Ontario NOrthland ( I think that is the road ) used to run a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Moose Factory north on Hudson 's Bay . It was the only way in and out . I think it still runs . <p> I have a loop that is 43 ft +/- and have a Vision Line Hudson pulling 6 , 18 " Pullman passenger cars . This is a short train . Would adding 10-12 mixed freight cars be OK ? If yes , would the passenger cars go at the front or rear ? I know , cars can be added as I want but just wanted some comments fron the experts and rookies on the forum . <p> Brent <p> In addition to the typical baggage , REA , and RPO head end cars , several railroads also ran " express " boxcars and milk cars as well as extra mailbag storage cars with their passenger trains . For example , the Milwaukee Road had special " nighttime " mail trains one of which ran the Hiawatha route between Chicago and the Twin Cities pulling a consist of RPO cars , mailbag storage cars , express boxcars , plus a few sleeper cars for passengers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in North America , freight cars would go in front , to make switching easier . But with 10 or 12 freight cars , you might want to place them behind the coaches because the slack action would otherwise result in a rather uncomfortable ride , I would think . <p> I do n't run any freight with my passenger consists ' except for a couple of Railway express cars sometimes . The only train is mix with freight is my Army train with my Lionel 027 green pullman 's towards the end of the train . I do n't know if this correct or not but it works for me. 175852 @qwx375852 <p> The Western Maryland Railway ran a combine baggage/coach ( and sometimes a coach too ) ( directly behind the locomotive its Durbin mixed train from Cumberland Md to Durbin WV Later this train was cut back to running between Elkins WV and Durbin . <p> Freight cars followed the passenger cars and a caboose was tagged on the end of the freight cars . <p> This train was usually pulled by a K1 Pacific or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discontinued in 1959 . <p> Mostly on other roads ' mixed trains , I 've seen the passenger cars at the end of the train after the freight cars . <p> I have a loop that is 43 ft +/- and have a Vision Line Hudson pulling 6 , 18 " Pullman passenger cars . This is a short train .... <p> Brent <p> In addition to the typical baggage , REA , and RPO head end cars , several railroads also ran " express " boxcars and milk cars as well as extra mailbag storage cars with their passenger trains . .. <p> Bob <p> Yes , I had heard , some years back , that such a short-line train was called a " Georgia-Mix " no matter where it ran , with perishables , like milk and fruit in boxcars up front and passenegr cars - few in number - trailing behind , all to make the trip financially feasible . I do n't know this as a fact - just heard it and ran it on the layout for some time . 175854 @qwx375854 175853 @qwx375853 <h> Block 175862 @qwx375862

I have never seen a standard gauge train or piece of track . How does it compare in size to O gauge ? <p> Paul , standard gauge is a little bigger than g scale or maybe the same size . The Locomotives and rolling stock were huge . The track and switches were still 3 rail . This stuff took up a lot of room to say the least . <p> One thing about trains , it does n't matter where they are going , it 's having the sense to get on . <p> standard or wide gauge track is 2.125 " gauge . you might find reference to 2.25 " , but early on gauge was often measured from rail center to rail center which added 1/8 " to both O and Standard/ Wide gauge in early catalogs . <p> in the prewar era , no actual prototype locomotives or equipment were modeled , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true of early O gauge , but if you were to go strictly from the track gauge , it would represent a scale of 1:26.6 . <p> check out the Tinplate forum .

@@36014946 @5014946/ <p> Mike to convert the engines to command control you would need to get with Electric Railroad as this would convert them to TMCC control . You could run your engines conventionally with the proper setup in either MTH DCS or TMCC/Legacy by remote without doing a thing to them . Buying new engines is a different matter . You can run either MTH or Lionel command controlled engines with either system alone but it will be conventionally . You can run Lionel engines in command mode if you have a TMCC command base hooked up with the DCS system . There is no perfect system that will run ALL the features of all the manufacturers engines . <p> Thanks for the info , however , it was still pretty confusing to me . I 'm somebody who has never seen or used anything other than the one transformer that can control 4 trains conventionally . I , to this point , do not fully even understand TMCC/Legacy or DCS . Is there any way to put it in black and white for me ? <p> Thanks , Mike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that intelligent , but with this stuff , its all new to me <p> Here 's a website that will give you a virtual try of TMCC command control . This is Lionel 's precursor to Legacy . The Legacy remote is more powerful and a little easier to use . To hook up TMCC/Legacy and run command engines as well as your conventional with the remote you would need the TMCC/Cab1 or Cab2/Legacy base system and at least 1 Powermaster or Legacy Powermaster per independent loop of track that you want to run a conventional engine on . So 1 loop = 1 Powermaster or Legacy Powermaster . Either command system will control up to 99 engines at the same time although that would be very hard to do . To hook the command system up you run one wire from the base to the outer rail of track and that 's it . Fire em up and em out . My 2 year old grandaughter was running a train in less than a minute . Here is the link to the coil couplers site try it out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So now I understand the control , but are you saying to control these older engines , I will need to convert them to the TMCC control ? I saw that you said I 'd need to get with Electric Railroad , is that a forum member or something I google ? The end result for me is that I 'd like to be able to control these three engines that I have and possibly an MTH that I may buy in the next 6 months ( if I have to control this seperately , that 's fine ) <p> Mike , for what its worth , you may regret converting these post war engines so please consider the nostalgic value , what they meant to you and your parents way back when . You would do better to invest that money in a new MTH or Lionel with all the bells and whistles you could possibly want . Just my opinion , from a post war guy who owns a couple of the new engines . <p> So your opinion is to keep these engines conventional and if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? For example I 'm looking into possibly buying a MTH Norfolk Southern that is brand new <p> Mike you do n't need to convert your engines to command control . With a Cab2 , Legacy base and Legacy Powermaster you could control one loop of track ( one Engine ) with the engines in there current form . No conversion needed . This would allow you control of speed , direction , whistle and bell if they have one . If you want to run multiple trains on multiple loops you just add another Legacy Powermaster for each Loop ( train ) you want to run . With the powermasters you will be able to run command or conventional engines on the track it controls . <p> Mike , Joe is correct . The new command controlled engines have a lot more features than just moving around and blowing the whistle . You can execute certain sounds besides the bell or whistle . You can also fire the couplers anywhere on the layout , turn the smoke on or off with remote and adjust the sound volume . Bear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to use all the features for that system you must use there engines . My comments are geared towards the Lionel system because in my opinion it is easier to set up and run and the fact that you have Lionel engines now . <p> If you really want to convert your older engines you can get the boards from Electric RR , which is owned by Lionel . However , the boards are going to cost more than your locomotives are worth . Also , all you would get from them is digital horn , bell , engine sound , and ability to give them an assigned address . I 've converted a couple of my postwar favorites but that was for nostalgia 's sake . The best bet is as mentioned above : run them in conventional mode using a Powermaster and a Cab-1 or Cab-2 remote controller . That is if you go with the Lionel system . BTW , Atlas , Weaver , and 3rd Rail locomotives can use the Lionel system also . MTH is the odd man out and only works with their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others have posted regarding " upgrading " the older engines . While it can be done it will not be easy or cheap and the engine will not have all of the features a more modern product would sport . Both DCS and TMCC/Legacy have mechanisms to allow you to use remote throttle capability for non command equipped trains . I think the coil coupler site has a tutorial on non command equipment . The names of the parts may have changed but the underlying principals are still the same . <p> Phooey on the powermaster . Powermaster has limited speed steps and almost no other features . Get a TPC 300 or a TPC 400 . They have built-in programming to utilize/operate many of the features in MTH locomotives of all vintages , as well as allowing you to operate ALL locomotives of any brand remotely . <p> I did n't  plan on converting them . Basically I just wanted to know the easiest way to control multiple older trains with newer technology . If I buy a MTH engine , its not a big deal if I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convert DC can motors to command control and also add cruise to them as well which you can not do to the pullmore motors . <p> RoyBoy the new Legacy Powermaster is supposed to render the TPC obsolete according to Jon at Lionel . It 's not out yet so it will be a wait . My guess it will have about the same electronics that the new ZW has which is 200 speed steps . <p> Yes , you can convert can motored loco 's to either DCS or TMCC butyou can only convert open frame to TMCC . <p> While the Legacy PowerMaster is a big step up from the original , Jon has been silent about support for the MTH PS-1/PS-2 macros that the TPC 's had built into them . I may not buy any more TPC 's going forward but I 'm not trading in the ones I have . <p> You can run conventional with a powermaster and Cab 1 . Cheapest scenario to operate with a handheld remote . This is how I run my dad 's circa 1930 's set . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gear . With a TPC you need a command base . Extra cost for no benefit if you are staying conventional - operating the engines with variable voltage to the track . <p> Mike you do n't need to convert your engines to command control .

I chose the DCS system since you can operate both MTH engines and Lionel engines with it . You can not operate MTH engines with the TMCC or the Legacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Legacy features with DCS , but that was my trade off ( I can not afford newer Legacy engines anyway , so I am not at a loss ) . MTH usually offers a bit lower priced engines if you are like me and do not have a lot of extra money to spend . You can always find deals for both brands , but you may want to research the catalogs of both companies to compare price . To run Lionel engines on DCS , you do have to purchase the command base for the Lionel system and connect it to the DCS unit ( the TIU ) . Anyway , it is a fairly big initial expense when just getting back into the hobby . I jumped back in about 6 years ago right when I retired . It was the new electronics that amazed and excited me . <p> So , that brings up the other question . I had postwar engines that I got as a kid . My parents gave me the 682 set and I got a 736 from a trade for a mowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time called Trains America Systems ( TAS ) that produced a similar product as ERR . I bought the boards and with their directions I put them in . I understand that that might be blasphemous , but the engines look exactly the same but now run under command control and have much better sounds and are less " toy like " . They are not but any means to scale , but they are great looking engines . Have I compromised there collector value ? Sure and that was a factor that caused me to balk a bit , but unfortunately postwar engines are worth a fraction of what many new Lionel Legacy engines and Premier MTH engines are today . I have not regretted one time doing that upgrade . I hope this helps . It is only an opinion of course and must be taken in context of when I jumped back in . TMCC had been out for awhile and DCS was fairly new . I liked the DCS controller better with the LCD screen so that I could see all of the functions , plus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Lionel vs . MTH modeler . I have both and enjoy both . As you have read I am sure on the forum each can have quirks that can be exasperating at times . Hope this has helped . <p> I have both Legacy and DCS systems and a number of each of the locomotives . Both have their positives and negatives . I find the Legacy controller a bit nicer then the DCS controller , but you do get a ton of options with the DCS systems . I started out with Legacy and added the DCS last year . <p> I agree with the opinions that I would n't jump right into converting locomotives right now , save that for any " special " models that you 'd really like to keep and use . You can regularly buy both TMCC and ProtoSound 2 ( DCS ) locomotives in the $200 range , and the upgrade boards will cost close to that for either system . <p> If you want a " one stop shop " for remote control of conventional stuff , the MTH DCS system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the remote and the TIU . The TIU is a four channel device , and two of the channels allow variable voltage control for conventional locomotives from the remote . You just add power to the inputs of the TIU and connect the outputs to the track . <p> If you want a " one stop shop " for remote control of conventional stuff , the MTH DCS system is probably the way to go . <p> DCS includes the remote and the TIU . The TIU is a four channel device , and two of the channels allow variable voltage control for conventional locomotives from the remote . You just add power to the inputs of the TIU and connect the outputs to the track . <p> So ... do MTH RTR sets come with DCS and TIU ? Or is that something I 'll have to buy separately ? If so , could you tell me exactly what I will need ? Thanks , <p> Thanks John .

I 'd see if you can visit some local clubs and see what others are running , and get a feel for the two systems and their application . We can talk endlessly about the pro and cons of either system , each has their strong points and weak points . In the end , you have to decide which system best fits where you want to go . Also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can add the other system and run both side-by-side . With both Legacy and DCS , you can run multiple locomotives of each command type at the same time on the same layout , the best of both worlds . <p> Thanks John , that definitely helps to know . I was in my LHS the other day and the guy informed me that with the DCS TIU system , I wont be able to run more than one conventional engine on the same loop . I picked up my new MTH Norfolk Southern SD70 and got to use the DCS remote for the first time . I like it , but then again , all I 've ever used in the past is the conventional Lionel controls . <p> Well , you ca n't run more than one conventional locomotive on a single loop with any system . I know somebody is going to jump in and say how they have three of them running , but it 's really not practical . If you want control , it 's only one . <p> The DCS remote is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lionel Legacy remote , even though the knock is it takes two hands . The big knob is far superior to the flaky thumbwheel on the DCS remote IMO . <p> ( I started writing this when ' mjrodg3n88 's last post was only 7 minutes old .. sometimes my posts take a while to write ) <p> For the longest time , conventional control meant one loco per transformer . <p> Some transformers had two or more controls built-in ( such as the ZW ) . You still had one loco per control , and running trains on both controls meant they had to be on physically separate loops of track . <p> Connecting the two loops with crossover switches usually meant electrically separating them , primarily by replacing the center-rail pin between the two switches with a plastic one . Each train becomes capable of changing tracks , with the complication being that if one train moves onto a track occupied by another , both trains are being run by one control handle and you lose independent control . <p> --Since both trains may run at different speeds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keeping them from running into each other without adding even more insulating pins to create sections of track you could disable with power switches , thus stopping one of the trains . But this is starting to get complicated , and you still do n't really have independent control of the two trains . <p> Enter command control . <p> The idea with command control is you ( or the factory ) outfit each loco with a circuit board that acts like a miniature robo-engineer that only responds to commands sent specifically to it by way of a remote that talks to a control box that either sits between the transformer and the track or in parallel with it . One power source supplies the track at a constant voltage ( usually 16-18 volts ) , but the locomotives suitably equipped only take what they 're told to do . This means multiple locos on the same track can all be controlled independently . <p> The two main systems on the market are MTH 's Digital Command System ( DCS ) , controlling Protosound 2 and 3 locomotives ( Protosound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sound board in a conventional loco ) and Lionel 's Legacy system , which is an updated , expanded version of Trainmaster Command Control ( TMCC ) , also made by Lionel . <p> Both systems can control conventional locomotives , albeit with the same restrictions of traditional transformer control outlined in my first four paragraphs . <p> --With DCS , the ability to do so is built into two of the four outputs on the control box , called a Track Interface Unit ( TIU ) . <p> --Under TMCC or Legacy , this requires a separate box called a ' track power controller ' ( TPC ) that connects to the TMCC/Legacy command base and acts as a remote-controlled transformer handle . <p> A DCS system can operate TMCC locomotives in command mode by connecting a TMCC or Legacy Command base to the TIU via a cable supplied by MTH as shown below : <p> Lionel made the control codes for TMCC public , as well as licensing the system out to a number of other manufacturers in an effort to standardize its system , which made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MTH kept its DCS control codes a closely-guarded secret ( and when Lionel developed Legacy , it also chose to keep the additional feature codes a company secret ) . The end result of this is DCS can operate a connected TMCC or Legacy command base , but it can only issue TMCC-level commands to Legacy locomotives . A TMCC or Legacy remote is n't able to talk to the DCS system at all . <p> Both systems can co-exist on the same layout . Since their transmission styles and protocols are different , you can run locos from both systems on the same track without interfering with one another : <p> In the above pic , the lead unit is a DCS loco , the one coupled behind it is a TMCC unit . I ran these coupled together pulling a train using just a DCS remote ( at the time I did n't have a TMCC remote ) , switching back and forth to sync up their speeds . It was a real juggling act , but I pulled it off . <p> By the way , locos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the advanced features wo n't be accessible . 175854 @qwx375854 175853 @qwx375853 <h> Block 175862 @qwx375862

@@36014948 @5014948/ <h> A Comparison of O to G Scales <p> There have been thread in the past regarding G in comparison to O scales . I recently decided to create a garage based G scale layout and also selectively thin down my collection of O scale by sales on Ebay , which has worked out so far . Its not a matter of either O or G as far as what 's best as far as I am concerned , but what works . I thought I would share what based my food for thought on this subject . Sometimes I think it 's good to place O scale in context to other scales . Going the opposite direction is S scale . As far as G scale is concerned in relation to O scale , here is what I came up with ... <p> 1 . Radio control command and control versus hard wiring everything compared to O. <p> 2 . The same equipment can be used both indoors and outdoors . <p> 3 . Garage storage presents no issues as the trains themselves are designed for outdoor use . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and O are at about the same level . Why not up-size at the same cost ? <p> 5 . The five foot minimum radius at center-line of G is not that much wider than three foot . <p> I kinda went down the G road before the switch to O in 1993 . I still have all my G scale stuff and have picked up a few items when I find great deals . Found 3 Bachmann cars , 2 coaches and a flat , local for about $20 . I have the trains and track to make a small outdoor layout but yet to do anything ...... <p> I started out in G-scale back in 2000 . Bought some inexpensive Bachman stuff . Liked it so much I upgraded to LGB . A few years later I got rid of it because I did n't have the time to take care of it ( the trains and the garden ) . <p> The pros : <p> I could keep it outside all year long . Though , I did bring mine in during the winter . <p> Engines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ track not compatible between manufactures . <p> Rolling stock seemed to cost more . <p> 2000 : <p> 2003 : <p> Johnny <p> The Western Maryland and the Pennsylvania RR hitting the high rail on my layout ! <p> I started with LGB in 1978 and quickly acquired several of the larger locomotives and passenger cars . Robust stuff made with high-quality BASF polymers such as Vestoline and premium Mercedes Benz paint . <p> LGB was the most durable of all of the outdoor G scale ( 1:22.5 ) equipment . <p> A REAL shame the Richter family lost the LGB business they started in 1968 ! <p> FYI : <p> Although the gauge for all the large scale trains is 45mm ( 1.77 " ) , the rail HEIGTH <p> I have No battery powered locomotives at this time , I do n't count the Lionel Polar Express . Eventually , at least one locomotive will be switched over to battery for traveling to others ' layouts . <p> I have a combination of .332 Aristo &amp; LGB track and have no problem with compatibility . I do use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , any point where a clamp is the most useful . <p> I have 4 ' , 8 ' &amp; 11.5 dia. curves . <p> Motive power is supplied by HLW , LGB , B-mann and several BASHES using HLW , LGB , Aristo &amp; USAT powerblocks . <p> Coupling is done with Hook &amp; Loop , Link &amp; Pin &amp; Knuckle Couplers . <p> One of my HLW Macks has hook &amp; loop on one end &amp; a Kadee knuckle on the other for switching duties . <p> For the trains that get the most run time , hook &amp; loop couplers . I have n't had much trouble with knuckle couplers on the rolling stock that has them , bread bag twisties usually fix any problems . The link &amp; pin are trouble free . <p> All of my rolling stock has been converted over to Bachmann metal or LGB metal wheels . Some of SWMBO 's cars have plastic wheels , but they get so little run time , it 's not a problem that a circuit or two with the track cleaning car ca n't take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4 ' dia. curves that will be made into 3-rail O track for an outdoor loop after we moved &amp; build new layouts . <p> Cost wise , i have n't purchased anything new in G scale for years , but prices for rolling stock &amp; locomotives seem to be close when I look at ads &amp; online dealers . <p> Of course if one is purchasing Accucraft &amp; other high end trains the prices are higher . <p> I agree Dave in terms of the comparison of Lionel battery powered control as compared to much more sophisticated systems being a moot point . <p> I converted all mine to knuckles due to the track profile . Bags of used Bachman couplers are cheap . Engines from USA at around $500.00 per pop compare favorably and you can see the detail without squinting ( at my age ) also I want to go this way because of the size being easier to deal with beyond my 63 years of age . Its all about preference but I thought the comparisons were sort of interesting as I came upon them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equipment outside all year long . It 's been tempting but have a large " O " scale layout to finish and many other interests . Photography , diving , kayaking and a few other things keeps us going . We just got mountain bikes . I gave my RC planes away because I just do n't have the time to fly anymore . Don <p> The five foot minimum radius at center-line of G is not that much wider than three foot . <p> Are you KIDDING Me ? I do n't have room indoors for the 072 curves that I would like to have as a MAXIMUM curve for my O Gauge layout that I want to build , I could n't even get a 10 ' diameter circle with adequate overhang clearences in the area that I have available for my layout , another 4 FEET in diameter not that big a difference ? I guess not if you live on a cattle ranch in Wyoming . <p> Do n't get me wrong , I have seen a few truly Beautiful Large scale layouts , but if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would just by-pass large scale , and get into 7.5 " gauge Live Steam . But for ME , 3 Rail O-Gauge fits MY wants and Goals the best , within my Time , Space and Monetary Budgets . <p> Just Because Large Scale is n't right for ME sure does n't mean it is not a Great choice for someone else , I Hope that you Enjoy your change of modeling focus . <p> I have a handful of Large Scale items , all in rather rough condition . I do n't have room for a layout , both indoors and out but this year I plan to be participating in the National Christmas Tree Railroad , a large G Gauge layout on the South Lawn of the White House . <p> I bought some 1:29 scale used engines and rolling stock . I paid $20 or less per car and about $100/diesel engine . For the cost of one Legacy steam engine , I was able to buy 5 locomotives and 24 cars and cabeese , enough for a couple of trains . Even the ( new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the stainless steel track ! <p> I enjoy sitting out on the patio with a pair of Santa Fe diesels pulling a dozen cars around the back yard . Very relaxing . So much smoother than my O equipment . <p> to be a little more fair to #1 gauge , it is really split into two general scales . those which treat the track as narrow gauge ( 1:20.3 also know as Fn3 , 1:22.5 &amp; 1:24 ) and those which treat the track as US standard gauge ( 1:32 and 1:29 ) . <p> the narrow gauges can turn circles as tight as most O gauge trains and was the initial impetus for these scales , to get a bigger train into a relatively small space , say a small garden . Fn3 is very accurate scale representing 3 ' narrow gauge . LGB never really admits their scale , but as it 's been mentioned ( and i 'll take their word since i have no equipment to measure ) that LGB as 1:22.5 represents European meter gauge . <p> US standard gauge on #1 gauge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ error in scale to gauge ) represented as 1:32 scale , many live steam models require up to 3 meter radius to operate . not really the same class as the traditional garden layout . <p> my biggest beef with #1 gauge , however , has to be 1:29 scale . as close as it may seem to 1:32 , it presents a scale to gauge error of over 9%. not only almost twice the error of O scale on 1.25 " gauge track , the worst part is that unlike O scale ( 1:48 ) which is over-gauged ( wheel spacing is 5% too wide ) , 1:29 scale on #1 gauge track is 9% UNDER-gauge. that is , the wheels are gauged too narrow for a prototypical model . <p> i can truthfully say that although i do not see the error in O , the error in 1:29 seems very obvious to me. sadly , with the ignorance of most modelers entering the garden gauges , people get trapped into this horribly overscaled equipment ( USA trains &amp; Aristocraft being the two biggest manufacturers of this scale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shelled out $3-4K for the USA 1:29 Big Boy profess they have the " largest G scale ( sic ) locomotive " . large , yes , but not even close to scale . <p> As I mentioned above , the meter gauge Austrian " Stainz 2 " loco was the inspiration for the initial LGB trains , and it was done in 1:22.5 scale . <p> Aster made the 2901 " Frank S " live steam loco for LGB and it clearly states it is based on a meter gauge German prototype , and it was modeled in 1:22.5 scale . <p> LGB 's efforts with the later US F-3 passenger diesels ended up being out of proportion to their truck gauge for US standard gauge models . <p> When you consider that issue of scale in G with O scale is identical in terms of proportion , again it 's pretty much a wash between the two as a basis of comparison . When I got involved in O , it seemed like O scale could n't make up it 's mind what it was , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equal across the board as HO .. what 's funny about it is that the larger the equipment , the more you get into these kind of issues . Not only that , you have the same variety on the plus side , in terms of what you go with all the way to 7/8 which is huge .. proportioned to a two foot track loading gauge . <p> I think what pushed me over after I hesitated for some time was the rising cost of the new stuff in O scale , and if I wanted to go beyond tinplate collecting , I may as well go back to G. <p> O is a great scale . I looked into dual gauge track but you can only run two rail O equipment and aside from the clockwork stuff , all my stuff is three rail ... dang . I ca n't have my cake and eat it too . The only saving grace is clockwork in Gauge One .. <p> I dove into G scale . The trouble was there was n't much available equipment for modern era . Sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in O scale . Probably thousands of pieces . <p> MTH entered G scale and I felt it was a great thing . They came in with the correct scale for the track and yet the G scale community hammered them . " Too small ! " " Close to O scale " . Some G scale guys are running 1:20 scale engines and cars next to 1/29 . They wo n't touch a 1/32 scale ? ? <p> They also complain that the MTH control system is too complicated ? It is hard to keep the red and black wires straight ? ? DCC is so much easier ? ? ? <p> I 've just got blasted on a G scale sight for supporting MTH and their equipment . Kind of like the atmosphere was a while back here in the " war time " . <p> Something not mentioned yet is that G scale building materials are easier to handle than O. I mainly decided on going O scale ( On30 ) rather than HO for this same reason . I like to build things and in 1/48 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scale is tempting for this same reason . The drawback I see with G ( 1/32-1/20 ) scale buildings is that the larger you get the more detail the eye expects . As an example , in HO the eye does not expect to see a door handle . If you want to be a rivet counter you can put a dot of paint . In O a rod is enough to look right . In G you really need an actual doorknob . <p> I am " toying " ( pun ) with the idea of getting a G scale setup if for nothing else than an around the Christmas tree set . Another upside of G is that I see sets all the time on Craig 's for cheap . Just this weekend there was a nice one for $40 , but it was 50 miles away . The next time I see one for $50 on my side of town ( Phoenix ) and I have the time I think I will get it . <p> The funny thing about MTH ( aside from the quibbling about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , their Big Boy got rave reviews in terms of what it can do versus how it looks in terms of proportion . Getting blasted is more probable at some sites than others . Some folks take all this way too seriously and any comment that is n't cheer leading their pets gets napalmed . Duck for cover ! <p> The Aristo Milwaukee Road Chippewa Pacific I have was gathering dust along with two heavyweight coaches .. steam in G scale is a sight to behold .

They eat up batteries and the locomotives usually have a very short life expectancy . <p> You can occasionally find them very cheap in charity thrift stores , especially after Christmas . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Goodwill for $14.99 . The locomotive actually ran , but it was purchased specifically for the open passenger/tourist cars . The locomotive will eventually be gutted and a Marx Wind Up motor installed in place of the battery powered motor . The pilot wheels and trucks &amp; wheel sets on the tender will be changed over to O gauge . <p> Thanks for the tip Dave . Unfortunately most of the Thrift Stores around here are the chain ones and anything worth buying can be bought new down the road at any big box store for the same price or less . I used to frequent Thrift Stores all the time but these days I rarely do for that reason . I am actually looking for a dead rail G scale if I get one , although I would get a live railer if it presented itself at the right time and price . I can cope with the battery issue for the limited usage that I intend . <p> I 've just completed a pretty extensive remodel of my backyard , and have been toying with the idea of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holding me back is the potentially enormous cost associated with changing my mind about something . <p> I spent months preparing plans for my O gauge layout , and in spite of that effort still had multiple changes during construction--not to mention things I would change now if I had the time and energy . Changing your mind along the way seems like a much less precarious notion building a small O gauge layout than it does a yard-size G layout . <p> You 're biggest expense , these days , will be track . But the beauty of that is that you can easily change your layout 's track plan a number of times , if necessary , without incurring a whole lot of additional expense . And the track plans for most garden layouts are usually far more simple ( and realistic ) than you 'll find on many or most O gauge layouts . A mainline and some passing sidings and spurs are the way it 's generally done , and with the greatest visual impact . <p> I agree with Allan on realism from experience in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was dealing with a different creature with G when I encountered real world engineering feats that needed to be done rather than using plaster , etc . Earth moving to create embankments to keep the grades steady , culverts to drain run off , etc . That being said , in many respects , the track represents a railroad in reality in of itself . In stead of molded in ballast as in O you use real ballast for the same purpose as the prototype to keep the track drained . Its a different way to enjoy the hobby in a new and rewarding way .. My garage layout should be a piece of cake to construct versus the former . <p> If you are interested in purchasing a G scale set , please contact me at the email listed in my profile . I can point you towards a great deal on a brand new analog set train set , track &amp; power supply . <p> I do n't know what your experience in g scale is by way of different products/mfg.s but my experience has been ... <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ G than in O guage . <p> LGBloops to anything else- yeah , delton to LGB to lionel to USA trains to Aristo toGreat American trains to Kalamazoo- never been a problem for me and I 've been messing with them since the early ' 80s . Kadee is on it 's own too like LGB loops ... forgot that one . <p> Many products have plastic wheels which build up dirt quicker than the metal wheels . <p> the plastic can also leave a residue as well- go metal ! <p> Scale is all over with G.

Have one large control panel where the transformer plug in on one side and on the other side the power goes to the various tracks and accessories . This control panel will have what I said above and room for expansion . <p> I can I use the DC/AC- DC LM317 Adjustable Voltage Regulator Step-down Power Supply Module Board to power both the voltage and amp meter ?

Semi permanent layout scheduled for late Spring 2018 . <p> Put your TVS diodes between the circuit breakers and the track . When you have a derailment , excessive current will be drawn from the transformer plus you will have voltage spikes occurring on your track power . During the voltage spikes , the TVS diode will conduct drawing even more current through the circuit breaker possibly helping it trip faster . TVS diodes also typically fail shorted . You want them after the circuit breaker in case this happens . The TVS diode will just blow the circuit breaker instead of blowing up assuming you have sized your circuit breaker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DC . I do n't see why you could n't feed all of them direct , I 'd probably pick a 12V Regulated wall wart for the power . In any case , what you 've picked is n't compatible with a 5V DC output . I do n't see the need for extra power modules , maybe Stan can chime in to let us know what he was thinking , I certainly could be overlooking something . <p> I do know that most of these meters need a totally isolated power supply from the measured voltage , so you 'll want a transformer isolated supply just powering the meters that has no common connection to the track power . 175852 @qwx375852 <p> Looks like it takes 9-12V AC or DC .

Of course , a couple posts down , you did clarify they were isolated , but I did n't read the whole thread . <p> One wonders if it 's a problem to use isolated power in parallel for powering the modules .

Or a separate wall-wart for each meter if that 's practical to wire up . The isolated converter supplies are only a few dollars each . <p> Originally Posted by gunrunnerjohn : <p> One wonders if it 's a problem to use isolated power in parallel for powering the modules .

That would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I agree that given a specific situation , it may be possible to power multiple digital meters with a single isolated supply ( or wall wart ) . But I found the scant technical info on the digital meter listing wrt isolation , impedance , loading , etc . Plus the isolated DC-DC modules are inexpensive relative to the cost of the digital meter module . <p> But as Kris has multiple transformers and is eyeing expansion , I 'd want a more general purpose instrumentation panel that is not hand-cuffed to a track wiring configuration . That is just my opinion . <p> My main consideration is the MA what I need for this project . Example do I need 4 or 8 these unit for a Postwar ZW , one each for the voltage and one for each Amp meter ? Or can I bus bar one unit for all of the voltage and AMP units ? Or am I dreaming and each voltage and AMP unit need it 's own isolation unit ? <p> Kris <p> A proud member of the Brotherhood of Carpet Layouts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Remember that those converters are fairly touchy about the input voltage , so I 'd be thinking of a regulated 12VDC power supply as input to the isolation modules . You can use one power source for all the isolation modules as they are providing total electrical isolation . I 'd probably use this identical converter as it 's a lot cheaper and also with free shipping : 371304256443 $3.32 . <p> As Stan says , the safe option is to use individual isolation modules for each meter . I suspect , though I 'd have to personally check , that for a single transformer where the common post is really common to all outputs , that you could get away with fewer converters . However , without looking at the meters in detail to see how the power source and measurement pins are intertwined , the safe bet is to use individual converters for each meter . Eight of the ones I mention cost around $26 or so . <p> You want regulated voltage in to those isolation modules , so I 'd look for a 12VDC supply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't all that important , I doubt you 'll be able to buy one that does n't supply sufficient current for a number of the meters . <p> This box is used with an MTH Z-4000 which also has built in digital meters and can be used to monitor either voltage or current . The red lamps on the circuit breaker box shown are used indicate power applied to the track and are illuminated only if the circuit breaker has been reset ( in normal condition ) . <p> I operate conventional , MTH DCS and Lionel TMCC engines using this same system . <p> All track blocks are also individually protected with separate circuit breakers and TVS diodes . Power to each block is controlled by a separate relay . Each block relay can be controlled by either a DCS AIU or by a separate miniature toggle switch panel . <p> An additional dual channel Emergency Stop circuit is used to remove power to all track blocks in an emergency . The E-Stop circuit uses both fixed E-Stop pushbuttons as well as Wireless " fobs " . <p> Since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TIU outputs to the track are also protected using TVS diodes .

@@36014952 @5014952/ <h> LION CHIEF PLUS QUESTION <p> A thousand pardons if this has been discussed before but I sure could not find it . My question is : Can the new Lion Chief Plus engines be run with the new Cab 1L in the same way a Lionmaster engine can be run ; i.e. 18 volts on the track , give the Lion Chief loco a number and let er rip ? I love the new Lion Chief Plus engines but can not imagine that I would need a collection of remotes to run them . <p> The short answer is , at present , no . The Lion Chief Plus loco is claimed ( no one has a production model ) to be either operated in conventional mode or with the specific remote that comes with the loco . It 's like having an extra remote for a second , third or more operator , but perhaps too many remotes could become a problem . <p> But Lion Chief Plus locos are planned to be considerably less expensive than TMCC/Legacy locomotives so that 's another plus . And looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to spring for $200-300 for Legacy or the 1L system to operate these . Not primarily intended for the long time serious hobbyist at this time , with multitudes of locos , I 'd guess . <p> I too would like to apologize if the answer to the following question has been posted but I would like to ask a follow-up question : Will Lion Chief Plus work in " radio control " mode , with 18 volts AC going to the track instead of using the DC wall transformer ? <p> I understand the wall pack puts out 18 volts DC and with that you flip the switch under the engine to " remote " and it 's controlled by the handheld remote . But can I have my ZW transformer putting a constant 18 volts AC onto one isolated block &amp; loop of my layout and have my grandson control the Lion Chief engine with the remote on that loop while I 'm operating the other loop conventionally ( variable voltage AC ) with the other handle of the ZW ? <p> Or to ask the question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " remote " will it only respond to the handheld remote if it 's powered by DC ? <p> For me , this is exactly what I 've been looking for and I think Lionel may hit a home run with this product . I 'm a conventional operator with old fashioned insulated blocks and cab control . My layout can be electrically set up as either one giant loop or up to three smaller loops , all completely isolated from each other . With Lion Chief Plus it looks like I will be able to run conventional equipment on one loop with one handle of the ZW putting out variable AC and the Lion Chief Plus engine on the other with constant 18 VAC controlled by the remote . <p> There is another thread where I posted some of the shipping schedule ( from the Lionel website ) . Basically half of the offerings in March , the rest in April . I have two locos pre-ordered , both coming in April 175858 @qwx375858 <p> O Gauge railroading has a LionChief Plus steamer in for testing . We are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I believe that Landsteiner is correct . Lionel has a real potential winner with LionChief Plus , because you get the best of both worlds , a simple command control system with great sound , speed control and electro-couplers that is fun to use , and the ability to run conventionally as well . <p> I think a lot of folks who have been strictly conventional operators until now will use command control with LionChief Plus and enjoy the experience . <p> Lion Chief Plus locos will work real well for me . About a year ago I purchased a Lionmaster Challenger and then the Cab 1-L when it came out . I like it a lot . My grandson loves the remote control Thomas set I got him . The LC+ is a good transition from conventional since it appears Lionmaster is off the table . <p> I did play with the Hudson , but what I remember is that the engine itself had a nice level of detail for a non-scale offering . Just ca n't remember whether it had four wheel trucks or six wheel truck on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a competing magazine , that had the speed range from 11 MPH to 60MPH . The LCplus locos will not fly off the rails like a starter set loco . If I find the review I 'll confirm or correct . 175858 @qwx375858 <p> From all the positive comments , it looks like LIONEL may have another winner to go with the RTR sets and VL BB . While the first Lionel Chief Plus offerings are n't on my radar , camel backs , more docksiders , and generals will certainly get my attention . OTOH , the more I run the Lionmaster Challenger , the more I like it . What an engine and thanks to LIONEL for filling the gap between RTR and VL . <p> POTRZBE , you make an interesting point about the gap between RTR and Legacy . Perhaps if the LionChief Plus is a success , Lionel will reconsider some of their LionMasters with the LionChief Plus . I wonder . <p> I would really like a LionMaster Challenger with LionChief . Was there a LionMaster Niagara ? 175858 @qwx375858 <p> For those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Legacy controllers , it is because they are not the same . Command , Legacy , and DCS engines receive their signals through the rails . LionChief engines do not . They are radio controlled like R/C airplanes , cars , and boats . Therefore , the frequency of the receiver in the engine and the frequency of the hand held transmitter ( controller ) must match . In order to run more than one LionChief engine at the same time and maintain individual control , they must be on different frequencies . This is why the controllers are " married " to a specific engine . <p> I read a review from a competing magazine , that had the speed range from 11 MPH to 60MPH . The LCplus locos will not fly off the rails like a starter set loco . If I find the review I 'll confirm or correct . <p> Ken , <p> I run my Polar LionChief berk on 18v Legacy layout . It will creep all the way up to ludicrous speed . Sometimes it surprises me and chuffs if I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a chuff every 5 seconds or so . I 'll have to pace it with my Legacy engine . It does n't fly off 036 curves a full throttle . Grandson does it in reverse ! Scares the ( ) &amp; out of me . <p> Moonman , that is very interesting ! Perhaps the difference being the 18V transformer supplied current ( probably just 60cycle AC at 18V peak ) and the Legacy power . Very interesting , I look forward to seeing if there is a difference between my transformers and included supply . <p> The LionChief plus were originally announced by Lionel with Oddessy speed control . 175858 @qwx375858 <p> someone mentioned in one of the early posts on the rtr sets , that they will also creep with the dc wall-wart . <p> I would expect the same from the plus version .

Shim it so the MTH building sidewalk is 1/8 " above the road . 1/8 " is equivalent to 6 " scale which is the height of a sidewalk . <p> You can also remove the sidewalk base from the MTH building and place it on a scratch built sidewalk , again made from Masonite .

@@36014961 @5014961/ <p> Have for sale three different Lionel " Electronics Platforms " with TMCC and RailSounds for diesel locomotives with Pullmor motors . Details are below . <p> Price is $105 each plus $7 shipping . ( Note that Lionel charges $140 each for these . ) <p> PayPayl , check or money order accepted . <p> E-mail me at papertrw@aol.com with your interest . Thanks for looking ! <p> Lionel TMCC and RailSounds Circuit Board Platform with RailSounds . This is the electronics platform that served at the heart of many Lionel diesel locomotives ( mainly GP-9 's and similar locos ) from about 1996 to 2001 . It can be used to repair a malfunctioning locomotive , or used to add TMCC Command Control and RailSounds to a locomotive that does n't have these features . The platform consists of two separate boards , connected by a four-wire harness . <p> The LCRU2 board contains the remote-control TMCC circuitry , and also functions as a reverse unit when a locomotive is in conventional mode . These are only used with AC Pullmor motors . Locomotives with DC can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be programmed via a TMCC CAB-1 to provide control of a smoke unit , cab light or strobe light . The Pullmor motor wire harness ( included ) is set-up to control one motor , but it does have the capability of powering an additional motor if you wire them together . <p> The RailSounds board contains both the audio and power supply circuitry . This board includes a set of functional diesel locomotive chips ( options below ) , but other chips can be transplanted into this board as well if you have a different set of chips you 'd like to install . Note that this board will only function with Lionel chips from RailSounds 2.0 and 4.0 . <p> Both boards are mounted to an aluminum platform that includes a 9-volt battery holding bracket . The boards could be separated from the platform and mounted individually , if so desired . As assembled , the entire platform measures approximately 7 " x 1.25 " x 2 " . <p> All connections to these boards are made via Molex or Leoco wire harnesses .

@@36014962 @5014962/ <h> LionChief+ and DCS Remote Commander Compatibility <p> I have four Lionel LionChief Plus locos , which I just love . I have been waiting for Lionel to offer LC+ in a higher quality diesel and a modern diesel . Well , Pats Trains had a great discount on an MTH SD70 set with the DCS remote commander , so I ordered the set . I received the set yesterday , and am happy to report that as expected , there is absolutely no problems or interference with running both systems on the same track at the same time . I provided power to the rails through the MTH infrared receiver . The LC+ locos worked normally regardless of the DCS signals on the rails for the MTH loco . On my Cisco RR layout featured in the latest OGR with Fastrack O-36 and O-48 curves . <p> A short comparative review between the MTH loco and LC+ locos : - not great ; + excellent ; ++ very excellent <p> Infrared : MTH : - LC+ : + MTH infrared controller must be pointed line-of-sight , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : + More details on the MTH loco <p> Painting MTH : ++ LC+ : ++ Excellent on both models <p> Overhang MTH : - LC+ : + The MTH SD70 is a large/long loco . The frame overhang is OK , but the TRUCK overhand on curves is silly . Due to the decision to leave the inmost wheelset/axle flangeless , the trucks stick out grotesquely on curves . <p> Thanks . This is a very good comparison . The advantage of the radio control on LC+ is that you can run it when Legacy and or DCS is running too ( or other LC+ on the same track , too , of course ) . I love it and wish Liionel would offer it on ever loco . <p> I can stand behind RTR and confirm his statements . I ran my LC+ Mikado at a recent National Capital Tracker event - and will run it at many more with the heavy holiday schedule . Running the same loop as a DCS and LEgacy engine , it did n't have any issue . It totally ignores the command @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best I can put it . Unfortunately , I had to go through two LC+ Chessie Mikados to finally get a good one ( #3 ) . In addition , poor service and treatment buy two Forum Sponsors in the process . Last time I 'll use them . Thankfully , #3 was a winner and is on the layout now . Only issue is the smoke unit fan stopped working due to my fault . At above mentioned show , I accidentally overfilled the smoke unit and the fan stopped working at the same time . My fault but I 'll get it fixed eventually despite me not using smoke units these days . Operationally it runs beautifully both with remote and a Z-1000 throttle . For someone like me that does n't have the $$$ for a Legacy engine and Legacy command system nor the room to run your big Legacy engines , this was an ideal choice and my first " modern " Lionel purchase that was n't a 4-4-2 train set engine with an air whistle ! <p> With my affinity for Chinese steam locomotives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've been day dreaming about one painted up as a " fantasy " Chinese 2-8-2 .........

So far I have run the LC+ and Legacy engines off the same ZW handle @ 18v but on two loops that are electrically connected . What I have not done yet , that I think can be done , is run a Legacy and LC+ engine on the same loop . <p> You got to admit this kind of technology is way cool , let me add to the mix and say you can also run conventional engines at the same time , thru the DCS TR and control all the different types of old and new trains together , when you are set up correctly . <p> Seriously cool stuff at Christmas time ! <p> PCRR/Dave 175857 @qwx375857 <p> Thanks guys .

@@36014963 @5014963/ <h> Why Gargraves over Ross track ? <p> Hi everybody , I 'm pretty new to the hobby . I 've set up an O scale layout for the last two years , and every year it gets larger and larger . I have a lot of O-27 track , but I 'm in the process of switching it over to something else . My plan was to use Gargraves track and Ross switches as this is the combo that most people recommend . <p> My question is , why not just go all Ross ? The track is slightly more expensive , but not much . Is this the only reason everyone recommends GG over Ross ? <p> I do n't have ( or want ) a permanent layout . I set my layout up for 3-4 months around Christmas time . So this means that I carefully connect and disconnect the track every year . Is GG more durable than Ross ? <p> Since I take my layout down every year , do you guys think the GG track with plastic ties would be a better way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's wood ties ? Somebody make up my mind for me ! <p> Thanks for any tips and advice as far as selecting track ! It 's been racking my brain for weeks now ... <p> As Charlie said , the decision is mostly for cost . The flexible track option with GarGraves also makes track laying a little easier on a permanent layout . But , for a temporary layout , the flex option is irrelevant . You want standard sections that can be disassembled and reused . <p> Both are about equal in durability . The individually spiked rails at each tie give Ross the edge in appearance IMO . <p> The plastic vs. wood tie issue is also irrelevant . Both are good . <p> On my permanent layout I have Ross switches with a random mix of Ross and GarGraves track . <p> If the layout is temporary I would recommend K-Line snap track . Add pins for better connections . RMT sells super snap and www.justrains.com has some larger curves leftover at good prices . Ross makes a tin plate switch that mates perfectly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mate existing O27 track to it . Here is Ross tinplate switches used with K-Line track . The straights are older K-Line with 3 shiny rails but the newer K-line is shadow rail . Click photo to enlarge 175852 @qwx375852 <p> I am a fan of Ross switches and Gargraves flexible track but if I were doing what you do , I would use all Ross products . I do not like Gargraves sectional track because of the plastic ties . The best place to buy Ross products I have found is directly from Ross . <p> I am also a big fan of Atlas track but I use it with Ross switches . I know that many here are big fans of Atlas switches , but they are the single largest creator of problems on mine and three other layouts I have help build . I would not recommend combining the two on a temporary layout . Also , if you are considering using the Atlas track and switches , any problems you encounter will be less severe because your track will not be screwed down and ballasted ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . <p> I think the Atlas O track is beautiful ! When I win the lottery , I will replace my track with all Atlas . <p> I have read many many threads on here about troubles with Atlas ( and others ) switches . I figure I might as well spend a little more and go with Ross . <p> My track plan is already designed with Ross track ( I used the AnyRail program ) so I 'm leaning towards all Ross . I 'll have to see if it all fits using GG track once AnyRail adds it as an option ( soon they tell me ) . <p> I have read many many threads on here about troubles with Atlas ( and others ) switches . I figure I might as well spend a little more and go with Ross . <p> I 've read some of that same stuff , but have not experienced any of these problems . I think that if you study closely the mechanics of your switches , you will be able to understand and identify where well placed graphite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long service life . In addition , should something go wrong , your intimate familiarity with the mechanism will enable rapid troubleshooting and repair . Solid installation techniques are also invaluable to smooth operation . <p> Dale H - That is ewxactly what I have with the addition of 8 K Line 031 , 042 and 0-72 Switches . I think the track looks great and is the actual old tinplate toy train track but with plastic ties . I also place pinns inn most of my snap track . Boy , It guarantees a good connection . Before I completely wired up my new apt size layout I could run my PS 3 engine arounf the whole table , all 3 loops with only 1 ( ONE ) power connection to the tracks . See my new layout in the track plans section . <p> Larry in Calgary <p> Larry3railtrains in Calgary , AB , Canada <p> As Sheldon says " There is ONLY " O " Gauge " 175852 @qwx375852 <p> I 'm in the same boat as you . I 've planned a back bedroom permanent layout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be utilizing any ( or much ) flex it looks like it 'll be Ross all the way . I like the " railroady " steel rails on wood ties , scale-like appearance , made in USA , reliability , ease of use , 0-31 product for compactness , sourcing from one supplier , ability to use manual switch throws . Even on straightaways , instead of long sections of flex I plan on sectional straight . This does n't seem the route for many on this Forum but it 's my way , and that 's all that matters . <p> I am late to the game here , I realize , but one of the things I liked about going all Ross was consistent look of the ties . I did n't want abrupt changes in tie color and did n't want to have to do additional weathering work to make Gargraves wood match Ross . If Ross had a flexible track option my world would be in complete harmony . <p> One other thing I recently noticed ( on the Gargraves and Ross track I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into groves cut into the wooden ties , on the Ross track the metal rails are not ( they 're bent underneath ) and are held in place with spikes . I would suspect the Ross track to therefore be a bit quieter than GG . It 's a shame Ross does n't make flex track . <p> I think the Atlas O track is beautiful ! When I win the lottery , I will replace my track with all Atlas . <p> I am sorry but this statement is rediculous ! one can easily find used but still new atlas o track sections on the secondary market from 40-60% off MSRP ! IF you want it you can get it ... even by the case loads ! with atlas o 's track construction , you do n't have to get all new track . The used is just as good with it 's SOLID nickel silver rail . One just has to watch out for broken spikes . and even if tyher are just a few broken spikes on a secion , the track is rEPAiraBle . SEARCH this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple of years ago . <p> FACT - A single piece of Atlas 40 " Flex track is $22 MSRP , Gargraves 37 " Flex track is $10 . That 's 2 GG for the price of 1 Atlas , any discounts or For Sale items on the forum for either brand will still be close to 2 for 1 . <p> Ross carries GG Flex Track at $6.50 ( min of 10 pieces ) , but like I stated in my above post , it 's not the same design . Public Delivery Track carries Atlas O Flex track for $15 each or case of 12 for $185 . I saw one listing on the For Sale forum for a case at $150 , that 's still $12.50 per section . <p> I bought a piece of Atlas Flex from my LHS ( at full MSRP ) a while back because I needed a piece of flex track and they did n't have any GG . It 's nice , no question , but twice as nice , subjective . <p> A quick measurement ( I had to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so I may have not had them held flat against the tie surfaces ) shows the Atlas ties are .189 " wide and .256 " thick . The Gargraves ties are .329 " wide and .230 " thick , thinner in thickness than the Atlas ties and visibly noticeable . Where Atlas wins out is in the solid nickle silver rail . If Ross ever offers flex track designed like their curved sections ( folded under , not embedded into the ties like GG ) then more testing would need to be done to see which brand is quieter . If Ross could be talked into making their ties narrower , then we might have a clear winner . <p> Ross and GG look alike at first glance , put a section of Atlas track in between and you can see the difference . If you look at GG track from the side , you can see the shine of the GG rail between/underneath the surface of the ties ( Not so with Ross track ) . <p> In the end it depends on what you want for your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my layout , that 's a lot of bucks no matter which way you look at it . After spending that amount and seeing how good they perform one ca n't help but think about buying their curved sections too . I fill in any gaps or long straight areas with GG flex track . My single piece of Atlas flex track is on a shelf where I store my freight cars , waiting for the next call to duty <p> I agree . I see you did n't put ballast between the rails , I have n't either on anything but the mainline ( and sections I 've redone ) . I 'm not sure if I plan on doing it either . <p> Did you paint your rails first ? I did n't and the shiny parts of the GG flex track can be seen ( between/underneath the ties ) so I need to get out a small brush and go round touching them up . <p> Does Gargraves and Ross go to York ? Maybe someone could try to convince them to " brown/darken " their rails @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rail , although that would be better than the shine there is now ) at assembly , possibly a dip in " Blacken-It " or some other product that would take the shine off . I would pay a few dollars more for them to do it vice me having to do it myself ( except I 've got all the track I presently need and can use ) . <p> Did you paint your rails first ? Air brush application of Polyscale Railroad Tie Brown after assembly and ballast . Quickly after painting the paint is removed from top of rail , etc . Choice of Railroad Tie Brown works well with the over-spray on the ties . IMO . I did n't and the shiny parts of the GG flex track can be seen ( between/underneath the ties ) so I need to get out a small brush and go round touching them up . <p> Gargraves has about the best price per foot vs the others . While the ties are n't perfect , it looks good ballasted . Atlas has a better appearance and is quieter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flexes into a smoother curve unless you try to bend it too sharp without a rail bender . For turnouts , I 'd use Ross with either track . <p> All of the track looks better ballasted , which hides the height of the ties not matter which track you use . 175856 @qwx375856 175854 @qwx375854 175853 @qwx375853 <h> Block 175862 @qwx375862

@@36014966 @5014966/ <h> Who Runs Conventional with DCS ? <p> I am considering purchasing DCS for at the moment will be 2 of 14 locomotives . Most are and probably will continue to be some form of conventional . I cant justify the price of DCS or TMCC locomotives so other than a rare super good deal I will probably only purchase conventional . But I do n't want to rule out DCS . <p> So my question is who has both and continues to run conventional locomotives using DCS ? How well do they preform , compared to traditional transformer control ? <p> I like the low speed from the MTH versus the Lionel . And more and more are DCS . Just like a SF F-3 I purchased . PS3 , would not respond , finally got it reset to conventional and on a test track works fine . I picked up a remote commander from a forum member and it does n't work . I found out after purchase the loco was run under full DCS and have concluded it was not reset to #1 so the Commander @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locally who has DCS , and the LHS is mainly HO . And even if I get it reset so I can access some of the features with the Remote Commander , the next thing will probably be another loco with the same issue . So maybe I should just bite the bullet and go DCS . But I do not want to give up my conventional locos , or start spending more than I can afford on new equipment . Or and this sounds crazy , just gut the loco , sell the PS3 , but in an enexpensive rev board , and an AC Sounder . <p> This reminds me of early PC 's . My wife or kids would want a new game , it was supposed to run on what we had , it sorta did , but not well . The next thing I would be buying a video card , more memory or a faster mother board , and usually all of the above . Sometimes I really hate anything electronic especially if it contains a processor . <p> On our modular layout , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The conventional track is run from the TIU so all three tracks are controlled by the handheld . <p> It works great ! <p> The conventional locos are in a world of their own running at whatever voltage the TIU provides ( controlled by the remote ) and the DCS locos do what DCS does well with all the bells an whistles , uncoupling , multiple trains on one track , etc . <p> I would suggest you get a DCS setup ( remote and TIU ) and use it for both . Even with conventioal trains it controls two separate tracks .... and it will let you do DCS when you want to .... win/win ! <p> Are most of your locos MTH with proto-sound ? ? ? if not you can run all your engines conventional with Lionel cab-1 with powermaster unit to control track power . <p> Only 1 protosounds and 1 proto 3 . The only reason to go DCS , at least at the moment would be to access the features of proto 3 , and to be able to do the same with future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reset them . Where if I get another one like this one , the basic Remote Commander wo n't function . But if conventional operation is not good , or a pain , or problematic , and I have to switch back and forth , I 'm not sure I can see a good reason to try it . So I was trying to find out how conventional operation worked for others . In many cases , Posts , I see were the conventional locos get shelved , but it seam more for the lack of the new features , but I do n't know that for sure . <p> First off , IMO , buying a CAB1 and a PowerMaster is a rapid advance backwards . With the DCS system , you can have two channels of remote controlled conventional operation and full DCS command capability as well . <p> I do n't have any conventional , and am by no means an expert on this , but I can think of 2 ways to do this . <p> 1 . You can use a conventional transformer with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up for DCS . Control the voltage with the transformer handle for conventional . <p> 2 . For conventional , use a variable channel . Full transformer voltage to DCS TIU and regulate the voltage with the thumbwheel on the remote . Use fixed channel for DCS engines for another loop of track and you could run both at the same time . <p> Pretty sure there are more ways to do this , I believe I have seen Barry and others describe them , but do n't remember where or how . Maybe they will be along shortly , to add more info . I think Barry 's book has more about this as well . <p> And to reassure you , using DCS to control track voltage for conventional locos works as well as if you had your hand on a throttle control on a regular transformer . It does take a bit longer to scroll from fast to slow using the thumbwheel , but it works well . <p> I run conventional through full DCS on my O-gauge layout and it works well . On my Standard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also . The Z-4000 transformers are fully accessible so I just use the transformer throttles . <p> And to reassure you , using DCS to control track voltage for conventional locos works as well as if you had your hand on a throttle control on a regular transformer . It does take a bit longer to scroll from fast to slow using the thumbwheel , but it works well . <p> Ed <p> Thanks this is what I was looking for . I 'd rather use one system for both . And if it 's just for DCS locos , I 'm not really sure I want to go that route , but if it works good to control conventional as well , then win win . I have two separate track , with crossover track , and might want a conv. on one and a dcs on the other , and one unit to control them . This is sounding like the way to go . <p> I have both conventional and DCS locos . DCS operation is so far superior to conventional that I rarely run conventional , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> That said , the beauty of running conventional through the DCS system is that you have walk around control--not tied to staying at the control panel . <p> Forget all the nonsense about special wiring . If I want to tun conventional , I use the track ( TRK ) control on the remote . If I want to run DCS , I use the ENGine button . No switches to throw . Any loco can go anywhere on the layout . I have also run both conventional and DCS at the same time on the same TIU circuit--just make sure the conventional train is heavier ( = slower ) than the DCS train , since you can slow down the latter without affecting the former . <p> It 's not really a question of 1 engine . It 's how do conventional locomotives work under that system . I need to do something , and maybe for once I should n't cheap out and end up spending more in the long run . I do like the sound and the idea of the proto couplers . But do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have . I 've added sound to a couple , just not command control . <p> I have both conventional and DCS locos . DCS operation is so far superior to conventional that I rarely run conventional , and have convetred most of my conventionals to DCS . <p> That said , the beauty of running conventional through the DCS system is that you have walk around control--not tied to staying at the control panel . <p> That 's one of the things I like . I have a walk around system now . But a couple of my Lionel with sound sometimes do strange things , and the new Proto 3 does not like it at all . I could keep this engine and downgrade it . But I 'll probably end up in the future with another one that wo n't like the system I have . I am also a little paranoid that I might damage the electronics since sometimes they act a little goofy . Sound Only . <p> Dlo , the beauty of DCS is more than just the sound . The ability to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ track as others , with full control over each , is great . <p> I did know that . I 've read quite a bit on this forum . I know if you have the command engines you can do all kinds of cool stuff . I was concerned that conventional operation would not be satisfactory . I 'm also still a little concerned that it might be too complicated , ( the remote ) , for me to remember how to use it , short of looking up stuff constantly . <p> Conventional locomotives run fine with the DCS remote . You can run conventional and DCS on different tracks at the same time , all from the DCS remote . Best of both worlds . <p> I think my fears of conventional operation with this system have been put to rest . Now I know you can get real complicated with this system , can it still be as simple or complicated as you want ? I am not the sharpest knife in the drawer anymore . I have trouble remembering some things . And am not able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Do you think I 'll be in over my head ? Right now I only have two loops , basically , 2 sidings , and plans for a small yard and engine facility . The present is a 4x8 with drop down sides making it 6x10 . I 'm going to do another 4x8 to connect to it . So it 's pretty basic . I do n't see any control of switches , possibly a couple of accessories for now . But I do n't want to paint myself into a corner for the future either . I just do n't want complicated until I 'm up to complicated . Does that make sense ? <p> Do NOT buy the DCS ...... unless you want to be forced into buying more PS2 and 3 engines !

And I diddled around just long enough to miss my best deal on a system while I watched that third video . <p> If you connect all 3 blocks to Variable 1 , you could control 1 conventional train on the whole layout ( with the ability to control another on a different track ) . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dlo originally asked if he could run a couple of conventional trains . He can with DCS . Even the DCS loco could be run as a conventional loco via Variable 1 or 2 . <p> None of the features that Dlo cited are " required " , but some of them might be fun ( under DCS ) ! You have a PS3 loco already - use it via DCS or conventional - what 's the big deal ? <p> Ed <p> ps . I have a cell phone with email , so I do n't use text messaging . Does that make it a bad phone because it has features I do n't use ? <p> On my layout , I have 6 " loops " /power districts/circuits--6 TIU channels--because when the layout was built in the early 90 's , that was the best way for conventional operation of many trains . Any loco , conventional or DCS , can go anywhere on the layout at any time under its own power , and be controlled solely by the remote . <p> I use 2 TIUs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outputs from a Z4000 with Z4k control box , which essentially means they are VARIABLE also . If I did n't have the Z4k control box , I could run everything from the 4 VARIABLE circuits , or move an old TIU from my workbench to my layout and use its VARIABLES . <p> On any layout , if a " loop " is fed by a VARIABLE circuit , both DCS and conventional locos can be run on it and controlled by the remote , using TRK for conventionals and ENG for DCS locos . If a " loop " is fed by a FIXED , you can set the voltage and the conventional speed by using the transformer handle or with the remote if you convert the fixed to variable by using a Z4000 transformer with the Z4k control box plugged into the back . <p> For a simple layout using both conventional and DCS and not needing more than 2 circuits , simply use the VARIABLE outputs for both and either . Why limit yourself by requiring that you move wires depending on what loco is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a second TIU , a Z4000/Z4k , or use the transformer handles . " Oh , conventional loco #736 is about to go to another loop . I have to shut down and move wires . " Or , " I want to stop running the old Lionel and run my new PS2 . I have to move wires around . " That is not simple . <p> To keep it simple learn to use 10 seconds of soft keys to change variable channels to fixed channels for command running . Following simple instructions is far easier than using some Rube Goldberg setup . <p> " Any loco , conventional or DCS , can go anywhere on the layout at any time under its own power , and be controlled solely by the remote . " <p> BUT THEN ... <p> " ... 2 VARIABLE circuits and 2 FIXED that are connected to outputs from a Z4000 with Z4k control box , which essentially means they are VARIABLE also .

If you need more circuits , use a second TIU , a Z4000/Z4k , or use the transformer handles . " <p> Some above have asked about the controllers being too complicated . I think with all the reading about them and what they can do is making you gun shy . <p> Both the DCS and the Legacy controllers are easy to use and for the most part buttons are labeled . <p> If you can find someone or a club or hobby shop that will let you try the controller your fears will be put to rest . You can learn to turn engine off and on , drive it , ring the bell and whistle or horn in a few minutes . As for all the other stuff you can just slowly experiment . They are not complicated for basic use . <p> " To keep it simple learn to use 10 seconds of soft keys to change variable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jim , <p> To be honest , when I tried this on my layout , a track which was variable is first turned down to 0 volts , then engine is changed ( pick up conventional loco , put down DCS loco ) . Then the channel is changed to Fixed ( softkey you mention ) , but I believe a watchdog is n't sent so the DCS loco does n't always come up in DCS " standby " . So I have to do a TIU power off/on to get the DCS loco in the right state . <p> I 'm not challenging , but maybe I 've been doing something wrong . Any thoughts would be appreciated ! <p> Actually , Eddie , if a variable channel is set to fixed , it comes up immediately at the input voltage , and with the watchdog signal . Since I usually run DCS , and my conventional locos power up in neutral ( except for ancient ones with mechanical E units and transverse motors that I ca n't convert to PS2 ) , I have set my variables to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loco batteries charge ( unless they 're in a block with the toggle switch off ) . With 20 PS2 locos , keeping the batteries charged is a consideration . I suggest you do n't move the thumbwheel after powering up ; just set the variable to fixed and see what happens next time you power up . <p> If a variable is set to fixed , once you roll the thumbwheel after pressing the TRK button , that track returns to variable for the duration of the power being on . Which means you can run conventional without moving your banana plug . <p> I do quarrel with your math . If I used your approach , I 'd need more TIUs , since each of my 6 " loops " would have to have 2 TIU circuits available . The system I have is needed because my basement layout , a 39 ' by 16 ' L-shaped giant , could have 8 or more locos running at once .

@@36014971 @5014971/ <h> locomotive drawbar pull and digital drawbar pull meters <p> Micro-Mark sells a digital meter which measures the drawbar pull that locomotives develop , up to176 oz . Am I correct assuming a loco reaches peak pulling power when it 's wheels begin to slip or does the motor reach it 's max " taxed " point before slippage occurs ? If the maximum " safe operating load on an engine 's motor " occurs before slippage , then what good are such measuring devices and what 's the point of using them ? Do any of the O gauge manufactures make known the drawpull their locomotives develop ? <p> I 've done a lot of draw bar pull testing . In my experience max pull , at least as told by the pull meter , is with moderate wheel slippage - too little or too much and the reading drops . YouTuber " ericstrains " says he uses 40 smph for his pull test ( I only run conventional but that sounds about like what I 've seen ) . The taxing point is current draw for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of chore to determine which motor a particular locomotive uses , and even more so finding the motor 's technical specs . From my research the Pullmor and Atomic motors are rated at 2.5 amps max continuous and the Mabuchi RS-385PH ( used in many newer locomotives ) is rated 1.5-2.0 amps continuous . <p> I will put a Fluke meter in series with the transformer to measure current draw .

If the motors stall and the current supply is not maxed out , then that is the maximum tractive effort . 175854 @qwx375854 175853 @qwx375853 <h> Block 175862 @qwx375862

@@36014979 @5014979/ <h> LCS Sensor Track with Atlas-O Track and Rossbed Roadbed <p> A couple of weeks ago , I mentioned that I was exploring how I might work Lionel 's new LCS Sensor track into a new Atlas-O layout without doing any surgery to the LCS track itself -- not that that 's a bad approach ... I just did n't want to go that route , especially if there was a way to interface an LCS Sensor track untouched . <p> I knew Atlas-O made rail joiners that transitioned from Atlas-O track to Lionel tubular . And I knew Lionel made a transition track designed to link Fastrack with tubular . So that was essentially my plan ... namely , to use purely stock items available from most dealers carrying Lionel and Atlas-O track -- with the two caveats being the resulting arrangement would be both functional and esthetic . On the esthetics front , I was n't looking for perfection -- just something that was pleasing to the eye and did n't stand out as something too kludgey . <p> So here we go ... here 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on either side : <p> I was intrigued by Rossbed ( available for Ross and Atlas-O track ) by Ross Custom Switches , after seeing it at York a couple of years ago . I liked the way that the Atlas-O track would actually " fit " into the custom-milled Rossbed roadbed pieces . So I purchased a few straight pieces to see how it would work in this environment . As luck ( or design ) would have it , the rail profile ( height and width ) when placing an Atlas-O piece of track in Rossbed matched PERFECTLY with the Lionel Fastrack transition pieces . All I needed to do was trim a small section of Atlas-O 's plastic tie-bed so the Atlas-O track would butt up directly against the Lionel Fastrack transition piece using the Atlas-O tubular rail joiners ( Atlas-O part #6095 ) . Here 's how things looked at first glance : <p> Note that although the rail profiles matched PERFECTLY , the roadbed itself did not ... which was actually not a huge problem at all . As observable in the above photo , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roadbed . But not so much so that a little ballast covering could n't mask the discrepancy . So before ballasting , I spray-painted the Rossbed with a flat granite/gray . The color was not critical -- just a neutral color so the light color of the Rossbed foam would n't be visible beneath a thin ballast coating . ( See below ) <p> Next I used Woodland Scenics " Gray Blend B1395 " coarse ballast over the painted Rossbed , and here 's a close-up of how things looked right at the transition to the Fastrack : <p> Here 's more of an aerial view as well ... <p> Perfect ? No . But workable for me ? Absolutely ! And better than I had hoped . Yes ... it 's true that the real ballast has more texture/granularity than the imitation ballast that 's integrated into Fastrack . But the difference was n't so stark to be objectionable as a showstopper ... at least not to my eye . What do other folks think ? <p> Anyway ... just thought I 'd share this approach for those folks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Atlas-O track and also want to incorporate Lionel 's LCS Sensor technology without doing surgery to the Sensor track . Obviously , if you 've already laid Atlas-O track on an existing layout with different roadbed , then this approach may lose some or all of its merit ... and you may find doing some LCS Sensor track surgery is a better approach for you . <p> In my case though , I 'll soon be starting fresh with plans that include two loops of O-Gauge track as part of a combined O-Gauge and Standard Gauge layout . And the Rossbed product will definitely be part of the bills-of-material when it comes to laying the Atlas-O track . <p> That turned out very well . Looks very nice and they line up quite well after ballast . I also use Atlas track and am thinking about adding some LCS sensors also . Looks like a nice way to add them to me . <p> I was going to suggest adding ballast to the Fastrack , but it 'll be somewhat time consuming . The ties do n't protrude like they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'll have to carefully " paint " it around each tie . <p> One thing you could do to minimize the length of Fastrack is to remove the Fastrack pins from the sensor track and mate it directly to the Atlas track using the Atlas to tubular track pins . <p> I was going to suggest adding ballast to the Fastrack , but it 'll be somewhat time consuming .

When the boom is lowered to its lowest point , the main hook is capable oflifting about 12 oz ( 3/4 lb ) and the auxiliary hook is capable of lifting about 7 oz ( 7/16 lb ) . Avoid lifting heavier objects to prevent damage to the Crane Car.Operating the Crane C <p> I just love mine , I was surprised at how well that they preform . One time I was able to latch onto and raise a die-cast tender off of the layout , this was from the crane operating from a bridge about 18 " above the accident . <p> I also have no videos of them operating . <p> I really like the CSX one that was before I went to need page to see the Bethlehem Steel crane . Also I then saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made and the Chessie . So now I have to make a decision on the Bethlehem Steel or the CSX or maybe both . <p> Hi Korling -I ca n't answer your question . I think when I came up with that , I was looking to build layouts for dough . Meaning , trains are more fun when they are running on a layout , not sitting in boxes in a closet . And I stand by that . Trains are more fun functioning , and nothing functions as coolly as the TMCC crane . The only thing you ca n't do what a real crane can do , is boom down while raising the hoist or vice versa . You can do either while swinging , which is cool . I was a Union Laborer for a bit back in my feckled youth . I worked with a crane operator all day giving signals , picking up and setting all kinds of loads on and off flat beds and whatever else in heavy construction . That is why I love cranes and this is one of the coolest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Just another for the crane/boom set . I have the BN set .. it has worked flawlessly . The most fun out-of-the-box accessory ... we 've had a lot of fun with it . <p> For Christmas layouts , I placed a Santa and toys in a plastic USArmy Willys jeep I built ( with a mounted .50cal , lol ) , and had it " stuck " on the tracks . My work train comes to save Santa and Christmas . ( I think I got the idea from a YouTube ) <p> As a DT&amp;I fan , I guess it would be hard for you to pass this up . Expensive , though . <p> I have the older CP crane car ... it really is nice piece and a pile of fun . Was n't able to snag the boom car at the time or since ( they seem to be hard to find ) . Thinking about picking up one of the legacy boom cars so CP 's not on her own ... I can live with the different line . Might even plunge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back in the catalog .... one of the most interesting items I have on the layout . <p> I had all of the Crane Car and Boom Car Sets , after letting folks on the Forum know they were available , I was able to sell 8 out of the 10 Sets .... the reason for selling , I ran out of room ... THEY ARE REALLY NEAT AND THE SOUNDS FUN TO LISTEN TO ... I think these were the most creative Action Car Set Lionel has ever Produced ... I like watching the Boom go Up and Down and All Around , and Control of the Hooks ... It 's a WOW . 175852 @qwx375852 <p> No question , one of the all time best items made for O scale/O gauge . It 's fun , reliable , a huge crowd pleaser , etc . Turn it on , hand your Cab-1 over to a kid and just try and get it back ! ! ! My four year old ca n't get enough of it . <p> I have the BN from a few years ago , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this time . <p> To the original posters question the answer is , Yes , I 'm very happy with them ( Santa Fe set ) and I would add , that I believe these would have been a " Vision " product if introduced in today 's catalog . <p> I have never heard of a rigging problem , but I can see that would be a nightmare if one needs to do that type of repair . <p> In my own case , the outriggers deploy , but sometimes they do not " stick " when pushed in . That for me is not a big deal , as I really do n't use that feature very much . <p> Reliability wise , we almost always have a set running during the Midwest Division TCA events , which is probably 6 or 7 times a year . <p> The other thing I would add is that the addition of the cab2 has made the set easier to use . <p> Great operating item . I have two complete crane set ups ( crane &amp; crane tender sound car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other is the steam NYC version . I wound up picking up a second crane once my two kids were arguing who was going to run the crane on the layout . They are a great fun for the kids , me too . The cable rigging on the boom is fine as long as you do n't turn them over without tension on the hooks . I made that mistake ONCE , not thinking when I was looking to install KD couplers on the crane . It took me at least an hour to figure out how the cabling was strung on all those pulleys . <p> They are great ! I ended up with two of them ( long story ) ; a diesel ( ATSF ) and a steamer ( BN ) , and I like both . ( Pictures below ) <p> As Rick said , there are many YouTube videos of the crane in action . Make sure to watch Mike Reagan 's video on setting them up . He describes every feature , but does not have the crew talk turned on ( ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just the " dialog " ? If so can you vary the volume of the other sounds ? ( does that count as two questions ? ) <p> 2. ( or 3 . ) Is the dialog different on the steam and diesel models respectfully ? <p> Thanks , <p> Paul <p> As far as the TMCC version is concerned : <p> Yes dialogue can be turned off , there is a volume pot on the boom car to adjust the overall volume there are not independent levels . <p> I 'm not sure about any difference in dialogue . All of the dialogue pertains to crane operation , i.e. " let 's get to work " , " raise the load " , " swing it left " , " lower the boom " , etc , as opposed to referencing crane power type . <p> The dialogue for the cranes seems a bit more realistic/ less cheesy than the crewtalk for locos . <p> Crane dialogue is more like construction site " man to man " foreman to operator verbal instructions . <p> Crane " crewtalk " is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action that you choose . <p> I have the PRR crane but with the Burlington Northern tender . Was going to do a re-paint but would prefer the steam sounds . Anyone interested in a tender swap ? Will not let go of the crane . Concur with most . Best bang for the buck in terms of coolness and fun . Kids get to play with two clam buckets , magnetic and hook . Plus an assortment of manual K-line , Lionel and Marx . No one touches dad 's TMCC crane under penalty of banishment from the train room . Lol . But serious . <p> I have the pennslavania version no boom car wish I had that . Mine is broken I think the motor board is bad . Not sure though since the status lights work on the motor board . The outriggers and couplers work so I know it getting commands . Has anyone had this problem .

The steam locos have combo decoders with a 1A Lenz motor decoder and Soundtraxx sound . This was done because of the Amp rating of decoders . If you blow a motor decoder , it is n't as costly as a combo sound unit . The H-8 's weigh in at almost 5 lbs each so any bind or stall places you at risk . The Berkshire is has two decoders also .

I soon decided that I only wanted command engines , so I had the T1 upgraded with DCS plus some additional features . As I settle on my late 40s era , I realized the MTH version of the T1 did not fit and now I wanted the Lionel TMCC T1 , which did fit the late 40 's . So , I traded my MTH ( now about $1,300 in it ) for the Lionel , worth about $500 on eBay . The Lionel did not have cruise , so I had it upgraded with EOB as well as LED lighting ( $300+ ) . When running it would short out on my switches , and some research here on the forum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I found somebody on the forum to take the drivers off and machine them down ( $150+ , maybe too much ) . The EOB never worked right so I sent it to gunrunnerjohn who fixed it for a very reasonable price . Adding in shipping , this engine has cost me a total of over $1,900 . <p> Was it worth it ? Yes . <p> Ron 175860 @qwx375860 175861 @qwx375861 <p> My most expensive locomotive is peanuts compared to others , but it 's a Weaver consolidation I bought on sale for $525 . It is a shelf queen that has never run properly . It 's awaiting a conversion from TAS to ERR that I hope will cure its woes once and for all . <p> In the market I deal in , pre-war and postwar Lionel mostly , price is pretty irrelavent and relative . I have found some high end engines at pretty decent pricing but the most I ever paid for a Lionel engine was for a very nice 736 . It is a great runner and worth the $$ . <p> Most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ever since MTH cataloged the Railking 2-8-8-2 Y6B as an Imperial model , I knew I wanted one . Do n't ask me why , I just " knew " ! <p> It was issued a few times and was never able to buy one . Spring 2012 they had been reissued again , this time as a set with the engine , coal hoppers , and a caboose . Uncle Sam also provided a very healthy tax refund that year . Naturally , I was soon on MTH 's product locator to see who had them . Eastside Trains had the set available and gave me a nice discount on the shipping cross country . I sold the cars and caboose ( did n't really want them to begin with , primarily just wanted the engine ) and it has racked up many happy miles . It is on the layout now pulling a nice tank train . <p> So far , that has been the most I 've ever spent and will remain the most .

@@36014996 @5014996/ <p> Labelle oil &amp; grease is good to use . They have teflon &amp; seem to work well . I have used them for years with success . You can find them at most any toy &amp; train hobby shop . Take Care . <p> Jeff I happen to agree with Keith here . Many complain about the cost but one thing - very important - IMO , is that these are SYNTHETIC lubricants and will not evaporate like we are used to seeing . They will not dry out . The weight ( viscosity ) and heat ranges are right for our trains ( big like SG , to small like HO ) and they will not attack anything that I am aware of . <p> 107 for axles and enclosed spaces like that , 108 is fine too but a bit heavier , this is what I use for my SG new and old , and 102 is good for rods and gears where any " slinging " might occur . <p> I 'm going to chime in with a third nomination for Labelle . Regardless of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best lubricants for your trains . The peace of mind is well worth any additional costs you may incur over other brands . <p> Like Art , I use the LGB oil for my tinplate trains ( previously Std . Gauge and now O gauge ) .

I never go for cheapest when it comes to maintenance products , and prefer to buy what works best even if it costs more . <p> I have been using Labelle since the mid-90 's with great results . Even stuff that has not run in ten years , I was able to get out , and it was still lubed to my satisfaction ( I still relubed , but that 's just me ) . <p> The only other experience I have is with Lionel oil and grease , and when compared with the Labelle , I tossed the Lionel . <p> -Michael R. <p> TCA 10-65677 <p> Even if you 're on the right track , you 'll get run over if you just sit there . <p> I use any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems for years , and it 's a heck of a lot cheaper than Labelle .

At the suggestion of Ives1122 , I went with Labelle . So far , so good ! I just started running my new 255E , which I cant wait to share with you all shortly .

It has Teflon , clings well , does n't get gummy , and is one of the slickest around . It is designed to work under much more severe conditions than could conceivably be encountered in a model train environment . If it works in a machine gun that gets so hot it will burn your hand , it will work in a toy train . It 's not awfully expensive and you can find it at any gun shop or sporting goods store that carries firearms . <p> Nothing wrong with LaBelle , I use their grease and occasionally their oils . One thing I 've noticed with LaBelle , their dispensers are kind of brittle , it 's easy to crack one if you 're not super careful .

I use a system of cranks and linkages ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bar .

So far , everything I find is for HO and not OGauge . <p> Switch machines know no scale , however throw distance is slightly further for O than HO . This is simply a matter of adjustment . Those videos are just as relevant , though as I stated earlier I do it differently . <p> Tortoise machines work great , but can sometimes be tricky to install since you 're working upside down under the layout .

@@36015000 @5015000/ <h> Trains and Christmas <p> Right now I 'm sure many of us are hard at work on our Christmas train display . Putting trains around the Christmas tree is a long standing tradition - whether or not you have a permanently layout . In fact , most permanent layouts have their roots around a pine or blue spruce . As we enter the holiday season , I thought it would be interesting to explore the traditional of putting trains around the Christmas tree and the general association between Christmas and trains . <p> It turns out that decorating under the Christmas tree is actually a long standing tradition . Setting up scenes under Christmas trees actually dates back to the 1700 's . The most common scenes were of course the Nativity but it quickly became tradition to depict other Bible scenes and eventually small villages , often styled after a family 's own home and/or town . <p> Trains started making their appearance in American around 150 years later and quickly became ingrained into our culture and history . The train brought family , friends , goods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those little Christmas villages started containing wooden and eventually metal trains . <p> Trains also symbolize the idea of taking a journey . The holidays , particularly Christmas are a time of travel and in the days before cars and planes all of that travel occurred by train . This has led the continual use of the train in art and literature to express both physical and abstract journeys . <p> We 're all very familiar with a young boy 's journey between doubt and belief in the Polar Express . In White Christmas , the train ride from New York City to Vermont is a catalyst for life changing events . Walt Disney used the train station as the gateway to his theme park and the train tracks as it 's outer boundary . <p> Christmas is a time of journey and change , so it 's only natural that the holiday and trains became intrinsically linked over the years . We can only imagine that initial excitement when electricity and clever companies like Lionel , Ives and others made it possible for those trains to run through those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that concept of journey come to life . It also did n't hurt that the circular and oval track plans fit the space under the tree quite nicely . <p> The holidays were also the perfect time to buy a train set . Larger scale electric trains have always been among the more expensive toys on the market . Christmas provided the perfect reason to splurge on a train set and a great occasion to keep adding another piece or two each year . Placing that train around the tree made it a focal point the whole family could enjoy . <p> It 's only natural that trains have become linked to Christmas over the years . As railroad enthusiasts , we owe this holiday a debit of gratitude . The spirit of Christmas has kept the spirt of American railroading alive and well . Trains have never stopped being an important part of our economy and culture . However , they have unfortunately taken more of a supporting role over the years . <p> Christmas is the one time of year when trains take center stage .

Obviously these are the exceptions and not the rule , but even still . I did not know that anyone did them . <p> Thanks for posting . These are golden . <p> When we had windows on our stores they were used like this often . Even " littler " downtowns would have windows filled with yuletide goodies . Whole " life sized " animation scenes ( or near it ) , maybe Santa waving from the window . No telling what you 'd see . One city once had an extremely large collection of very old animated window displays it assembled for the holidays to create a " Santa 's Fantasyland " ( from Hudsons ? ) .

Christmas and trains certainly seem synonymous for the reasons you suggest , especially so for those with a passion for model trains . <p> As a longtime collector of antique Christmas , I 'm delighted when one appreciates naturally shaped trees of Christmases past . The last photo I posted , No. 12 , best represents my Victorian collection . As you can see , the ornaments are generally large and best displayed on relatively sparse trees . The problem is that un-sheered trees are unpopular thus difficult to obtain . No one wants the Charlie Brown . As evident in these early photographs , the imperfect trees lend themselves to the magic that is Christmas . <p> Great examples , Joe . I find your last photo intriguing in that the tree incorporates the chandelier and sports two finials . It 's primary decoration is tinsel roping and tinsel wire ornaments with few blown glass ornaments . Note the sailing ship with it 's Dresden sails with glass hull , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and center . <p> The tree above is much less modest . This example is quite lavish with it 's many glass ornaments , definitely the product of a somewhat wealthy home . <p> Here 's some more info on this subject . I find the whole thing , trains and trees and miniature nativity villages very interesting . To think people would put so much time and effort and money into Christmas decorating . But then they did n't have all the Black Friday sales to spend time and money on either ! LOL <p> I have to say if it was n't for Christmas this hobby would probably not hold my attention , at least not for very long . It was the same when I was a boy ; Thanksgiving marked the beginning of the season and that 's when the electric train set came out . By February/March , the season was over and so was the interest in trains .

@@36015003 @5015003/ <p> Rather than continuing on in the other threads where this has been being discussed I thought it might be worthwhile to start a new topic specific to using Arduino for panel meters . <p> The premise here is to use an Arduino micro-controller , LED/LCD displays , and Hall-Effect current sensing modules to build a set of highly accurate panel meters to monitor the voltage and current of each output on a transformer . I 'm planing on 4 channels at this time , but the design is expandable for many more if needed . <p> I 'm also planning to add some extra features , some of which are quite useful , and others that ate neat , but not really so useful . The primary added feature is high speed , programable circuit protection . Because we already will have a micro-controller monitoring both instantaneous current and voltage , as well as RMS current and voltage , it should be fairly simple to use that information to shut off track power if current rises too high . What this current limit is could be adjustable by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , allowing say 1 amp over current for 10 seconds , 2 amps over for 5 seconds , 3 amps over for 2 seconds , etc until at maybe 5 amps over the set level power would be instantly shut off . <p> As a clarification of terms , when I use the term instant here , I mean within the realm of the limitations of the speed of the electronics and the mechanical limitations of whatever device is used to disrupt the flow of power . In effect this is likely to be in the realm of 15-30 milliseconds , competitive with the fastest acting breakers on the market today for electric trains . When I have a working prototype I 'll have to test to see just how fast the device responds . <p> At least 1/10th second refresh times on the displays , with a user adjustment for preferred refresh speed . ( ex. some folks may not like seeing the numbers jumping about so quickly and may prefer slower changes . ) <p> Programable , adjustable electronic circuit breakers for each channel . <p> Real time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why and how this matters , in a huge block of useless text ) In effect this will provide extremely accurate readings from the meters as well as the ability for the meters to operate on any power grid or source , as well as being operational with DC power . <p> LED and/or LCD displays for RMS voltage and RMS current , peak voltage and peak current ( over , say , the last 30 seconds ? ) , possibly an indication of any DC offset on the signal , and if I can figure out how to do so , a warning that a high voltage spike has been detected . <p> I 'd like to hear what other features might be desired in this project from other folks so I can see if they could be worked in . Also , do folks prefer simple on/off circuit breakers that could be handled with a relay , or would it be worthwhile to investigate designing a fold-back system that will lower voltage to limit current ? <p> The actual parts I 'm planning on using are all fairly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect modules will be used for current sensing . These will provide 1/20th Amp sensitivity up to 30 amps , and should not be damaged by less than 50 amps . For voltage measurement I 'm planning on using a bridge rectifier to feed a voltage divider made of two resistors . This will convert the AC track voltages into a 0 - 5 VDC level that can be read by an Arduino . If my math is correct we should be able to read RMS pure sine wave voltages up to about 36 volts with 1/20th volt resolution . I plan on using a zener diode to clamp excess voltage from damaging the Arduino . <p> To provide the most accurate measurements , it may be that I will have to use several Arduinos linked together . Once I have parts I 'll be able to test things to see if a single processor will be fast enough to take all the measurements and process data for the displays . if it is not , I plan to use a separate processor for each channel that will report data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is more complex than the alternative , which is to use something like an Arduino Due which has an 84MHz CPU , as opposed to the 16MHz found on the less expensive boards . The Due has it 's own issues , the biggest one for me being that it requires 3.3V logic levels as opposed to the 5v logic used on other boards . Another option may be to use Raspberry Pi instead of Arduino , but I have only a limited understanding of RPi . <p> In the end , mu goal is to use the most cost effective route that will provide exceptionally accurate results . I think there are already plenty of great products out there for mediocre accuracy , and do n't see much point in reinventing the wheel if it will not bring something better to the table . Here in the planning stage it looks like I 'll be needing around $30 in parts to provide the desired features , however if a single , faster microprocessor ends up being needed it will quickly double that price . This also does not include @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to install as a fail-safe . <p> Anyway , let 's see what we can come up with here , let the comments commence ! <p> JGL <p> Note #1 : When measuring for True RMS the frequency of the AC matters . in the US we typically have a 60Hz line frequency , however in other parts of the world 50Hz is standard . Further more , there are slight fluctuations in this frequency throughout the day , often being fractionally less than 60Hz at peak power consumption times of the day and fractionally above 60Hz through the night when there is less power consumed from the grid . Power grids in the US follow a rule that they must average out the number of cycles in a full day , but do not care about the exact line frequency in any given second or minute . While there have been some tests to see what effect it will have by changing , at the moment , the US power grid provides exactly 5.184,000 cycles every day . This is done so that devices such as clocks and timers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> In the case of measuring for true RMS to get a truly accurate reading you need to measure an absolutely exact amount of time equal one full wave period , or a multiple there of , ex : 2 waves , or 5 , or 10 . Because of this I 'm planning on measuring the frequency of current so that accurate measurements can be taken . I do not know if this level of accuracy has any need for layout meters , but the difficulty in programing will be similar just to allow for automatic adjustment for 50Hz or 60Hz grids , so I may as well see how it works in real time . I think that it may prove too taxing on the processor to check frequency too often , but it should be little trouble to update every 60 seconds or so . If that does n't work out I 'll simply have a single check at start up . <p> $ This is John Galt live for mine . " <p> First off thanks for creating this thread and I look forward to learning and sharing ideas . I have read your above post , but I think I will have to read it again to try to understand the electrical portion . <p> I would like to add the following to what you said . You mentioned a larger microprocessor as needed or the Raspberry PI . Why not use an Arduino Mega if you need to go larger ? Also , I think that you can use a Raspberry PI as needed too and would be very easy to learn in my opinion . A lot of people typically program in python for Raspberry PI , but you can also use C to match the Arduino if you are sending data back and forth . Check out wiring pi , which is the wire library used on Arduino for Raspberry Pi . Here is the website , http : //wiringpi.com/ . Raspberry PI can also be setup for I2C . <p> This also maybe a dumb question , but why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I have seen the voltage sensor on-line today . Maybe it is me because I 'm just learning the in depth electrical stuff , but I find that it would be neater to have the voltage divider on a PCB board . <p> Crood58 , What i mean by larger is not the typical problem with needing more I/O pins , but that the processor may be too slow to keep up with reading all the sensors , do floating point math , and keep the displays updated . All of the common Arduinos ( Uno , Nano , Mega2560 , 5v ProMini ) have 16MHz processors . Now this really is very fast , but a number of libraries place a high overhead on the processor , so I 'm going to have to test things . One of the biggest CPU hogs I 've run into is the serial library , which really sucks when trying to debug code . <p> As for the voltage modules , the one 's i 've seen do n't really look like a good deal to me , and they do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ACS712 modules , the modules cost less than $2 each and an actual ACS712 chip alone costs over $4 . Chinese economics at work . For the voltage sensors you 're paying 75 cents for a penny worth of resistors , and still need to add the clamping diode to protect the arduino , and a rectifier to convert the AC to DC . <p> I 'm expecting that I 'll have to put together some sort of ' mother board ' to connect everything together where I can install various modules and discrete components . For folks that may be adverse to soldering , I 've also had good luck in the past using solder-less breadboards , then pouring wax over the breadboard to hold everything in place when finished . With as cheap as breadboards have gotten this may be the way to go . <p> JGL <p> $ This is John Galt live for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the caution , and expect that a full battery of testing will be in order to insure everything works as expected , however when it comes to component level electronics and mass produced modules , you can take the quote from the movie Armageddon to heart : <p> To date I have never had counterfeit parts shipped , however there have been reports of such things happening . From what I can tell these counterfeit parts tend to be duds right out of the package . On occasion similar parts from different manufactures are shipped , but these often say as much in the listings . Such similar parts are usually interchangeable . Listings show part numbers and data sheets are available for those exact parts so that you can see what differences exist between one manufacturer and another . <p> All in all I 'm unsure what parts there is concern over here . The various chips at use in arduino boards are proven reliable , whether based on the ATmega2560 , ATmega328 , or the old stand-by ATmega168 . The ACS712 is the industry standard hall effect current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basic components that are the same everywhere and in everything . The only part I 'd have any concern over is a relay used for disconnecting track power . This will take some research to find out if the sort used on the relay modules have any sort of issues with contact welding or arcing under currents below their max ratings . <p> In general parts meet the specs given . They can often out-perform those ratings , but it is not usually the case that they under-perform . I did mention , as well , the intention to use glass fuses in the event of a catastrophic failure of the electronics . I expect these fuses to never blow , however as the processor would report a failure of any crucial part and go into a fail-safe mode , refusing to apply power to the track . <p> In all honestly I have no concern about the quality of the parts , or at least no more concern than with the parts in any other electronic device . I would take it as a prerequisite that anyone following along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blow anything up , and not to power an expensive train until they are sure it works , but I just do n't really see a cause for concern with this project , or with anyone experimenting and designing their own circuits . <p> JGL <p> $ This is John Galt live for mine . " <p> I 'm very interested in over current protection , as I have damaged my fair share of electronics . I 'm currently using polyfuses , but I think they 're too slow to cut power . I would love to see a fairly inexpensive way sense over current and simply drop out a relay , much the way the old TMCC lockon did . I need quantity , something like 70 units . <p> Bargain parts from Asia and home made circuits are not the best protection for expensive model trains . <p> I have destroyed many toys with bargain parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I have 40 years of making , fixing and breaking electronics . <p> No offense , but all your fancy electronic trains are using parts from China , where they are also made ! Most of your other consumer electronics are also using parts from China , and probably made there as well . <p> As far as " home made " circuits , what makes you think you ca n't engineer something at home to the same level as stuff made in some " factory " . In many cases , the corners cut to save a component or two , or to shave the price a few cents on production , results in an inferior product . <p> I spent over 40 years designing electronics , including many products used in high-reliability applications . Much of my career was in Aerospace designing cockpit instrumentation and fuel systems for commercial and military aircraft . I think I have a pretty good handle on how the stuff on the other side of the wall is designed and built . <p> John , one option that might be interesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You 'd have to reconsider the display technology , but in many cases the analog response to change is a lot more useful . Many displays in cockpits are displayed in analog fashion for that reason . Many multi-meters have the analog display bar at the bottom so you can see what 's happening when the digital display is changing too fast to read . <p> I know , I 'm making it complicated ! <p> The inexpensive relay modules that are available in everything from one channel to sixteen channels would be a good match for this project . Here 's a four channel one with optical isolation and 10 amp relays for $2.69 shipped free , there are many more examples . <p> This is a bit more complex than it appears if you are also looking for that order of accuracy . <p> Depending on how you rectify the AC , you will have a fixed voltage drop due to the rectifiers , which will need to be part of the RMS calculation . Not insurmountable , but if you start with a 1.2 volt drop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true RMS world , you ca n't just add the offset at the end . There are ways to allow for it , but in any case you lose all the voltage data below the level of the diode drop , compromising accuracy . <p> You could design a perfect rectifier using an op amp with a diode in the feedback loop ; this is quite well documented in the literature . A quad op amp of almost any sort would probably do . Or , you could use low-drop diodes of some type , or forward-bias plain old silicon . <p> To your credit , you are learning why low-cost readouts , free multimeters and model train transformer displays seldom agree . They just ignore all the fine points and wing it ! <p> IMO you are trying to over Engineer this safety problem for you train layouts . I have never damaged any of my P2 or Legacy Engines when using the 7-10 Amps Scott type Breakers and the TVS in the DCS-TIU . So far they have provided me with all the safety required on my layouts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to use the 5 Amp Breakers on , however this might be slightly over safety protected we will see . <p> PCRR/Dave 175857 @qwx375857 <p> You could design a perfect rectifier using an op amp with a diode in the feedback loop ; this is quite well documented in the literature . A quad op amp of almost any sort would probably do . Or , you could use low-drop diodes of some type , or forward-bias plain old silicon . <p> I was going to comment on the same thing , the diodes are going to be a problem . I like the idea of the active circuit solution . <p> Eliot , I think if you eliminate the display portion and are only concerned with the circuit breaker portion , you could build banks of 8 breakers for about $25 . This would assume that each one is set to trip at the same level , and a max instant cut off less than 10 Amps . Still need to wait for parts to get here and do some tests , but it seems workable at this point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stage I think it is advantageous to dump every possible idea in the mix , then see if anything has to be scratched off the list later . I like the idea of a visual , non-numeric display to show quickly changing readings . It may be that instead of a simple LED or character LCD that a dot-matrix LCD would be in order that would allow for ' graphics ' . I 've never worked with one of those , however , so will need to learn what is involved . Another option might be a simple bar-graph LED . <p> The relay module you posted is exactly what I had in mind at the start , but for main track power I do n't think 10 Amp rated contacts will be enough . I need to do my homework here , but I think I 'm going to look into a 30-50 amp relay . <p> PLCPROF , good thinking here . My brain works in the world of DC , and did n't really think this one through . I suppose I could limit the problem a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be entirely accurate . Going to have to look into the Op-Amp method or see what else exists if we want truly accurate readings . <p> Dave , I understand the idea of over thinking it . The thing is the circuit breakers here are an afterthought . The idea is for volt and amp meters , and it just so happens that once that part is built , you may as well add circuit breakers that should be competitive with anything else on the market for speed , for the cost of a relay ( and transistor and opto-coupler , etc . ) . <p> JGL <p> $ This is John Galt live for mine . " <p> The relay modules are so cheap that you can pick on to your specifications . Personally , I think 10A is all I 'd ever want , I do n't believe in putting more than 10A on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide logic outputs that would hold the relays energized and release them for over-current . This allows you to hang whatever capacity relay you think you need to do the switching . <p> You could also use something like this , I have a few of these in my parts drawers . They handle 25 amps and would certainly be fast switching . They switched 18V just fine , there 's about a 1V drop through the switch , not too significant . $2.88 on eBay : 331822808867 <p> The relay module you posted is exactly what I had in mind at the start , but for main track power I do n't think 10 Amp rated contacts will be enough . I need to do my homework here , but I think I 'm going to look into a 30-50 amp relay . <p> I would n't hesitate at all to use a 10 amp relay module . Look at the relay in the highly-praised PH-180 , it is certainly no better than the typical Chinese module relay . If you still feel the need to go bigger , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ switch faster than a 30 or 50 ampere relay . An 8 channel module would give you four 20 amp circuits ! <p> GRJ , I 'm not picking on those relay modules , I think they are absolutely fantastic ! The thing with current is that if i 'm looking to match what I think of as the industry standard , the PH180 , I need to handle 10 amps all day long , and have a sliding scale up to about 17 amps for instant cut off . <p> Ad a note , just looking at the picture , that SSrelay is only rated for DC , which I think is the case for many of them . If I do the solid state route , I think I 'll opt for a triac or FET . <p> PLCPROF , I hope the relay in the PH180 is rated for more than 10 amps . Am I remembering correctly that you tested the breaker on one to determine the sliding scale they use ? <p> As for putting two in parallel , I thought of this , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contact at the exact same instant , and if they do not , one relay is carrying the full load for a fraction of a second still . If I could find a module with double pole relays this would be more of a solution . <p> At this point I think I 'm going to go forward with the cheap relay modules and a 10 amp maximum peak rating on the device , and perhaps leave connection points for a larger relay for those that need one . <p> JGL <p> $ This is John Galt live for mine . " <p> I would be happy with just the volt amp meter part of the project , but you have gone way beyond that with a lot more nice features . For circuit protection here , I have some PSX-AC 's , which might be something I could give a shot at comparing to the circuit protection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You might have to help me along a little with the proper way to compare them though . You guys are all way ahead of me so I will just follow along and try to keep up ... <p> I agree with this sentiment . Yes , for discussion or forum purposes it 's fun to blue-sky ideas , but my interpretation of your basic premise is to leverage the relatively recent availability of attractively priced digital processing , instrumentation , and display modules and apply it to train power measurement . IMO if you can teach an Arduino to provide both digital and analog ( emulate a dot/bar graph ) display , even a single-channel volt amp meter would be a contribution to the hobby . I 'm assuming you 're thinking of something that could be easily replicated by other OGR members . The reality is that like soldering and dealing with tiny electronic components the Arduino is not in most guys ' comfort zone . The vast majority of OGR readers ( from what I can tell ) would just as soon buy a ready-to-run solution . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ display that easily drops into a control panel cut-out is a big win ... in my opinion . <p> Or if you " solve " the recurring question of whether or not and what kind of isolated DC power module you need to operate those eBay digital panel meters then that would be a contribution . <p> So if this is really in the " planning " stage ( as opposed to the implementation stage ) I suggest more discussion of WHAT it is rather than HOW it is done . Arduino vs . RaspPi is HOW . Electro-mechanical vs. solid-state relay is HOW . Voltage sensor vs. resistor divider is HOW . Bridge-rectifier vs. op-amp rectifier is HOW . <p> That is , I 'm bogged down by your initial statement , the meters to operate on any power grid or source , as well as being operational with DC power . <p> Are you saying you want to ( accurately ) measure true RMS voltage and current for chopped-sine supplies ? How about DC supplies ? DCC supplies ? <p> Or your statement , provide exceptionally accurate results @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speaking , resolution is easy . Accuracy is hard . And exceptional accuracy is exceptionally hard ! IMO I do n't think you need exceptional accuracy . That goes to WHAT ... which is my point . Once the horse is before the cart , I would claim the accuracy of the intrinsic Arduino measurement system is not exceptional . <p> Very interesting ideas . A gold star for your inspiration and willingness to go before the peanut gallery ! <p> I 'm assuming you 're thinking of something that could be easily replicated by other OGR members . The reality is that like soldering and dealing with tiny electronic components the Arduino is not in most guys ' comfort zone . <p> Oh , I do n't know how important that is to the project . The OGR forum is positively overflowing with scenery and super-detailing and realism that I personally could n't duplicate for any amount of money , let alone easily ! Nothing wrong with working on a project for the Arduino guys ! <p> I suspect we are at the reality check stage , where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the WHAT . Or , to put it in terms dear to my heart , Engineering is pushing back on Marketing . <p> LOL . Well , yes and no . IMO your projects are ( generally ) problems looking for a solution . In this case it 's arguably leaning toward a solution ( Arduino , inexpensive Hall current sensors , etc. ) looking for a problem . For a forum and beer-drinking conversation there 's nothing wrong with the latter and it 's an interesting topic . But as I 'm sure your industry experience has shown , the " everything but the kitchen sink " approach to product definition is a recipe for disaster . <p> Let 's see where we are ( this is a long one ... sorry , brain going in too many directions all at once . ) <p> RTR12 , once we have something that works , I 'd really like to run some tests head to head with other products that are considered top of the line . I think the Arduino will keep up with the best of them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet . I 'll have to build an adjustable load bank for testing , or come up with a simple load solution for others to test with . I have some ideas here , but I do n't quite think we 're at that stage yet . <p> As mentioned before the circuit breaker part is sort of an add on to the meters. it 's not needed , but only adds the cost of the relays to the project as we already have the Arduino monitoring the current . It should n't take much to say " if current is over X , turn off the relay . " Just slightly more complex to add a sliding scale as discussed above . It may be that if this ever turns into a marketable product , or a ' how-to ' instruction guide that it will have the circuit breaker portion as an add on to the basic meters . <p> As far as trying to keep up , please ask any questions you may have . I 'm certain there are things I 'm overlooking in this project and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fairly simple to learn , but the best way is to start building something ! <p> Stan , thanks for the star . At this point i 'm looking for everything , including the kitchen sink . there are no stupid ideas , just ones that will turn out to be unworkable for some reason or another . <p> If this works out and proves to be something that is as good or better than other options on the market , I would n't mind trying to produce a ready to use device that does n't require any specialized skills or knowledge to use . Another option might be to offer a standardized motherboard that would allow folks to buy their own parts and simply plug everything together . At some future date I 'd like to offer some products and services for sale , but that is not today . <p> For me , form follows functionbut , it makes sense to make sure that whatever is used can be made to look good . <p> I 've never been one to care much about having a ' finished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many folks . I have access to a lot of useful tools and such both of my own and through my company 's print shop . While injection molded plastic is currently not on the menu , almost everything else is . I 'm thinking of using acrylic plastic with dye-sublimation printing to make a panel that could be dropped into a control panel . <p> You can see the sort of display I was originally looking at by typing " 8 digit LED Arduino " into the auction site . I like these because they use only 3 I/O pins for 8 digits and probably less than that as at least one pin can be shared between displays . <p> I 'm not sure if these will be optimal now and am going to look at some other display options . by the time you have the LEDs , for primary displays , LCD for additional data , and a bar-graph for detail of fluctuating readings I think everything is going to be quite cluttered . May be better off using a single dot-matrix display , or even scraping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ native support for HDMI video output . May be overkill but with folks wanting nice large meter displays , you could pick up a $129 32 " TV and clearly see the readouts from the neighbor 's house . I 'm going to kick this idea around a bit more , buy it will require me to brush up on my python skills . Going with a RPi would eliminate any concerns for CPU speed as the current $35 model has a 1.2GHz quad core processor . The down side is that the RPI does not have native support for analog inputs , so an AtoD chip will have to be used or an arduino go between more ideas happening as I type Stupid ideas getting in the way of things ! <p> On a couple of your comments , Stan , I do intend to measure true RMS for any supply connected , no matter what the waveform looks like . I honestly do not know enough about DCC to know what is needed , and am unsure if it will be possible . I am imagining that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a DCC or DCS setup , such that we do n't have to worry about signal issues . If it is the case that the meter needs to be made compatible with the DCS signal , that is something that I 'll have to do homework on . <p> As for exceptionally accurate readings , I suppose we need a definition of terms . I suppose what I mean is ' better than anything I am aware of in current production for model trains . The voltage meter end of the design is currently up in the air , so I do n't know what we will end up with , but the current sensors , at least according to the datasheet , read in 1/20th of an Amp increments . I suspect the over all accuracy then will be with in 50mA of what it reports . Testing will be in order to see if these sensors actually report accurate measurements or not , but the information I have on them suggests that they do . Perhaps installing a load resistor in the device so that it can self @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or in the vein of KISS , simply forming a calibration procedure for new units . <p> EDIT : ( for preceding and following paragraphs ) still some good info here on ADCs and such , and it may be useful for the volt meter portion , but upon further reading of the datasheet for the ACS712 , it seems this device , in the 20A version , is only accurate to a tenth of an amp this may require some rethinking on my part , or it may be that 0.1 amp is good enough for people <p> While the Arduino 's 10 bit ADC is not fantastic , it is exactly enough for 1/20th Amp resolution with the 20 Amp version of the ACS712 module . Seems I forgot that spec , so with the 30 Amp version we 'd go down to 1/13 amp resolution . I think , however that even a reading to the tenth 's of an Amp is better than most of what is out there right now for trains , and even more so if we know that the reading is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up being the micro-controller of choice , however , it 's need for an external ADC opens the door for a much higher resolution . There are also very inexpensive I2C interface 16 bit ADC 's from chin that might be just the ticket if the 10bit ADC on the arduino proves insufficient . With 16 bits we go from 1024 desecrate values ( 1/20th A on 20A sensor ) to 65.536 increments , ( about 1/1300th amp , better than 1 milliamp resolution . ) I 'm unsure if the module outputs sensitivity that low , but if it does , I may go the 16 bit route just for fun . <p> I agree that the solution here is far in excess of the problem , but there is a problem none the less . For me the problem is that I 'm unaware of even a reasonably accurate panel meter solution that is also reasonably cost effective . I 'm also unaware of a cost effective electronic circuit breaker . All of these things do exist , I just think that throwing it all in one box @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a better quality product than anything currently offered , AND cost less than these other options . I 'm not a genius with figuring our MSRP but if we go the most expensive route for everything thus far discussed , a nice looking box and a 7 inch touch screen display we 're still only looking at about $100 in parts for a 4 channel unit . Even at $200 retail for a finished product the cost is less than just that of 4 of the high speed electronic circuit breakers . Going with a simple , dumbed down version with just simple 7 segment Volt and Amp displays and nothing else , we 're looking at maybe $ 60 retail , which does n't seem bad at all for true RMS panel meters . <p> So , As I 've been typing thoughts out here it occurred to me that the best solution that would make the most people happy might be a modular design . You have voltage and current sensor modules that provide serial , I2C , or SPI data output as one module . You could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than relay boards , really . Then last could be a user choice of various display modules . Perhaps a ' basic ' version that uses the simple LED 7 segment displays and only reports the current RMS voltage and Amps in typical panel meter fashion and which would be rather inexpensive . then you could have the choice of a more complex display , utilizing a 7 " or 10 " color LCD touch screen that will display all the little quirks of information that the sensors can provide . <p> Sorry if I babble too much . I tend to do that when brainstorming ideas . Please , toss the kitchen sink in the mix as well , you know there are some really neat water-level sensors for Arduino ? <p> JGL <p> $ This is John Galt live for mine . " <p> I like the idea of the circuit breaker capability , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each channel and to drop it if the current is excessive . As you say , once you are accurately measuring current and voltage , adding this capability is fairly simple . For folks that want circuit protection , you just add the cheap relay module . <p> I will be following along . Probably wo n't be able to offer much technical assistance though . <p> Also if you happen to have a Micro Center in your area they have the Inland brand Arduino Mega 2560 's ( SMT chip version ) on sale for $9.99 each , so I now have an Arduino Mega . Maybe more costly than the Asian suppliers on ebay ( have n't compared them ) , not a bad price and I was right there in the store already ... They also had sale prices on Arduino Pro mini 's ( $3.99 ) and Raspberry Pi 3 Model B 's ( $29.99 ) . I do n't know if those are good prices compared to ebay or not , but if you have a Micro Center nearby , it 's handy and much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now have a pretty good selection of electronic parts , Arduinos and related items now , looks a lot better than Radio Shack to me . Seems like they have more and more electronic stuff every time I visit . <p> Forgot to add , it is pretty impressive that you have already received a gold star too , and so early in the project . That 's a good sign ! <p> RTR12 , I own one each of the genuine Arduino Uno ( $25 , paid $35 at RadioShack ) and Mega($45) , and a genuine SparkFun ProMini ( $10 ) . I purchased these mostly because I believe in supporting the original designers work , but I ca n't afford these boards for actual projects . That said , every other Arduino I currently have , about 20 boards all told , are the MicroCenter Inland brand . At the sale prices , which have been about the same for the last 3 or 4 months , they are reasonable enough for me and I like the connivence of a 15 minute drive over waiting a couple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ China , Megas run about $8 , Unos about $4 , and Nanos and proMinis are about $2 . There 's savings that will add up on large quantities , but for prototyping work , I 'm very happy with MicroCenter . As for the RPi , I do n't currently own one but have messed around with a first generation board quite a bit several years ago . <p> JGL <p> $ This is John Galt live for mine . " <p> To be clear , if the purpose of the discussion is to add to the ( long ) list of things an Arduino can do for trains , OK and I 'll stop harassing you ! I 'm simply reflecting on dozens of OGR threads on panel volt and current meters and the issues/problems in applying them . <p> Separately , in the **30;396;TOOLONG category , just as the $2 Arduino causes one to ponder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the $1 power-metering IC chips that integrate dual-channel A/D converters and computation of true-RMS with revenue-quality ( power company meters ) accuracy . I think you will find a few tips on sampling frequency , calibration , accuracy , bandwidth , etc .. as it relates to the specific problem of measuring 50/60 Hz AC voltage and current . For example , here 's a block-diagram of the Atmel M90E26 available from DigiKey for $1.45 quantity 1 . <p> Similar chips are made by Microchip ( of PIC fame ) and many others . For all I know there might be an eBay Arduino module that integrates one of these $1 IC chips ( via SPI ) . So this could eliminate the need to " reinvent the wheel " of true RMS calculation of AC voltage and current and all the attendant issues with A/D frequency , resolution , accuracy , etc . OTOH , this HOW would not measure hi-frequency DCC voltage/current. 175852 @qwx375852 <p> Stan , you always toss in that lowball price , which kinda ' kills the incentive to build something . It 's pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the US for less than around $20 by the time the smoke settles . <p> Because of low-volumes in hobby trains , and yet lower-volumes dealing with O-gauge AC , leveraging electronic modules meant for other high-volume applications seems like the only practical way forward . And unfortunately the " glue " to put these modules together still requires , in many cases , soldering , wiring , messing with tiny components , and so on . <p> It is happening to some degree now but at some point sending data or software to other OGR members ought to make these projects easier . That is , an Arduino-based widget could be updated by simply plugging into a USB port and it magically gets new features . Or guys exchanging MP3 recordings of train sounds to play on their MP3 sound effect modules . Or the 3-D printer data file to make a broken piece on an engine body . Presently , the only member exchange that comes to mind is sending the data file to print out a tach timing tape for a DCS flywheel ! <p> In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this devolve into one-off showpieces - I 'm imagining JGL using a 32 " flat-panel screen with HDMI interface to display the 4-channel voltage and current data ! Of course it is these one-off showpieces that serve as inspiration for the next great idea . <p> I have been doing some more research on this and was wondering about the voltage diver to read the voltage . The divider would have a bridge rectifier that feed two resisters right ? The resisters would knock down the voltage to 0-5 volts . What I 'm not understanding is that the divider and Arduino board would have to share a common ground , correct ? The ground from the Arduino would need to be connected to the ground from the voltage divider . Does this create any problems if the Arduino is wired to an ATX computer power supplie that is supplying other Arduinos or devices ? <p> I 've kinda put this project on hold due to work keeping me very busy lately , but have done a bit more research . At present I 'm weighing the pros and cons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undecided if it would be simpler to use a power metering chip that does everything internally , or to go with the separate current and voltage sensors . <p> I 've found that the sensors I originally wanted to use are only good for 1/10th amp accuracy , and the onboard ADC of the typical Arduino will give at best 1/10th volt increments . While this would be ' good enough ' for track power monitoring , it is not nearly as accurate as I was hoping for ... which has led me to looking for more accurate sensors . <p> to measure true RMS of AC voltage we ca n't use the rectifier , as it will block any voltage under about 0.6 volts from being read . The best solution I 've found so far seems to be the method described by the open energy monitor project found HERE . <p> The values of the resistors in use will have to be changed for track level as opposed to the mains levels the circuit is intended for , and the step down transformer is likely unneeded . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arduinos and multiple meters can share a power supply , but the ground of that supply can not be connected to track/transformer common . This is because the common of the transformer must also be put through a voltage divider to the ground of the arduino so that the arduino can read both the positive and negative parts of the wave , and so that the negative voltage will not damage the Arduino input . <p> In addition to this I 'm thinking of using an add on 16 bit ADC ( analog digital converter ) as opposed to the 10 bit on board one , which will increase resolution by more that 60 times . ( theoretically giving about 1 mV resolution if my math is right here . ) <p> Anyway , the short of it is , I think that one power supply could be used to run as many meters as you want ( assuming the sources the meters are reading have commons connected together ) , but that power supply could not be used to power anything else sharing track power . <p> I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a couple different current sensing methods that may be better than the modules I was first looking at as well , and with the addition of 16 bit ADCs should be able to get fairly good results . I wo n't know what happens in the real world until I have time to hook parts together . <p> JGL <p> $ This is John Galt live for mine .

Note that if you choose to support DC measurements ... such as accurately measuring the track voltage when the Horn or Bell button is pressed , then using a transformer will not work since it does not pass DC . <p> The link you provided shows an " active " op-amp circuit to shift the mid-point . For the application of shifting the mid-point level , the gain/amplification of an active circuit greatly reduces the burden on the measured voltage . DC level-shifting circuits that use passive-only components can get tricky such as narrow range of resistor values that work without compromising accuracy . <p> If you 're using an external A/D converter ( instead of the internal Arduino A/D ) they have bipolar input converters that operate on a +5V DC but have a bipolar input range of , say -x Volts to +x Volts . In other words the level-shifting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and range scaling ( i.e. , precision resistor dividers ) are built-in . You will pay ( dearly ) for the convenience of having these functions integrated in the A/D chip ! <p> As you study input methods note that an ideal voltage measurement instrument has an infinite input impedance so as to not burden the device being measured . But if your voltmeter only needs to measure a train transformer output you get a lot of design flexibility . So check the assumptions as you read how-to articles , application notes or whatever about designing a voltmeter . <p> I read your response and somewhat understand . I 'm a little confused though . When I was talking about the ground I was trying to say that they should be separated correct ? Meaning between the train/layout power and Arduino . You stated that ground from the Arduino needs to be connected to the divider . This would n't connect them ? Would a voltage divider still need to be used if an ADC is ?

The issue is the huge amount of slop between the hole and the shaft so the tension from the belt actually pulls it crooked and the blade no longer runs parallel to the wall and will rub . I ca n't do anything about the sloppy fit but I added a very thin washer between the blade and the shaft and screwed it back on ( be careful its just pretty soft plastic so do n't over tighten screw ) .

Some specific advice : <p> 1 ) For covering large surfaces like backgrounds , base coats on mountains and so on , check out latex paints from the " oops " counter at the big box home improvement stores . Exact color rarely matters , and can be easily adjusted . <p> 2 ) For everyday painting of all kinds , go for the $2 craft acrylics from a craft store or WalMart .

I learned this from following the work of Troels Kirk , who is a professional painter and a master modeler . This is an incredibly useful and subtle color that somehow brings scenes to life . <p> 4 ) For stains and weathering , you ca n't beat ink/alcohol mixtures . Artists inks are available in many colors--kind of pricy , but they go a long way . <p> I agree with Pete . Good advice . I use acrylics exclusively , as the fumes from enamels is just bad .

In other words , when the right rods were at their lowest point ( the " bottom quarter " ) the left side was on front dead center . The Pennsylvania was the biggest user of left-hand lead locomotives . Someone theorized that it was because PRR had so much multiple-track territory ; the most solid part of a multiple-track roadbed is toward the center , and since the side of a locomotive that has the lead is the side that pounds the track hardest , PRR wanted the locomotive to pound the most solid part of the roadbed - the left hand side . <p> Questions #3 <p> Why did n't the Pennsy duplex-drive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rear engines , to eliminate the slipping problems ?

At the time just before WWII there were experiments using a lighter Alloy of steel that was stronger as well . It had elements of Silicon in the steel . These were going to replace boilers on their Z6-Z8 challengers . Unfortunately by the time they were delivered after the War the NP started the their shift to FT and F3 motive powered units and the boilers were used for Hi-way drainage ditches ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Steel do not like each other , Magnesium is even worse ! ... <p> What does galvanic corrosion have to do with metals used in rods on a steam locomotive ? ? ? <p> Galvanic corrosion is an electrochemical process in which one metal corrodes preferentially to another when both metals are in electrical contact , in the presence of an electrolyte . <p> For design and engineering , the use of metals that interact in galvanic environment are usually avoided due to high cost in insulating them .

Back in the 1930s and 1940s , they had not developed aluminum alloys to the extreme strengths we know today . <p> I accept your explanation that aluminum is n't practical for rods on basis of STRENGTH - not because of galvanic corrosion issues . <p> J Daddy posted : <p> For design and engineering , the use of metals that interact in galvanic environment are usually avoided due to high cost in insulating them .

True Aluminum has roughly a 1/3 the strength the properties of steel , however with physical cross sectional strength this can be made up for ... the true down fall of mixing metal materials is how they oxidize in a climatic environment . <p> If you have Al antennas in the Houston area , you better put a coat of clear coating on them , or else they will pit .

" <p> Remind me not to fly on your plane . If you mix steel and aluminum fasteners on structural elements on airplanes ... that is one doomed airplane ... If you look real close on the wings and fuselage as you fly you sill see the use of Henrobs , which are self piercing aluminum rivets . They join the aluminum panels and seal the outside elements from corrosion / oxidation .

Timken may have made only the forging , with final machining by either a loco manufacturer or RR vendor . Aluminum is too brittle to use for main and side rods , and PRR should have realized that . Timken lightweight rods are very strong , especially considering their relatively small cross sectional area , but precautions must be taken so the rods are not " knicked " . I understand that in the steam age most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't believe it is a coincidence that the locomotives identified above with Timken rods are all among the most highly regarded . <p> here 's a " fun " example found at a " kids restaurant " since I 'm no chemist or alloy expert . <p> The water race has a water gun and large squirt guns . The guns are aluminum , the tubs stainless steel . They do n't touch . The water flow alone makes enough connection to cause the stainless tubs to crack without much vibration , over as soon as a year if distilled water is n't used to prolong the tubs life ! It should be changed weekly and mine lasted for many , many years that way , but I saw plenty of other fail with tap water . There is no current , all pieces connect with hose , no contact till the system pressurizes , ( pump to gun ) and fires ( gun to target ) then drips to the tank below . Very Little is a direct flow from gun to tank . The target carries extremely minimal dc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to failing . <p> You 'd think the aluminum would be the metal with the issue , but it 's not always the case , both can fail . <p> When discussing the issue , airplanes were my first thought . I was told the metals were coated then . <p> Engines using aluminum rods etc were my next question . Nobody could answer ...... but the tubs crack , so I just accepted it as a fact , always considered it , and moved on . Aluminum tanks were an option but they were hard to keep clean , &amp; easy to destroy . <p> Semi related , the old air cooled VW block was an Alum/ , Mag alloy . More aluminum to pure aluminum was used in later versions to make the cases more repairable , less brittle , and not have unstoppable Mag . fires . It will burn as a fuel if it gets hot enough . I do n't think water puts it out either. ? ? <p> You 'll find unusual pitting inside on both steel and blocks of very old and original @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw that in an all steel engine . <p> My GUESS on motors , etc. is the stainless alloy is less reliable than forged steel in these conditions , but the issue does remain . Oil films help discourage contact .. ? ? <p> Adriatic , I suspect that a lot of the problems with the stainless tanks in the water game is that it is suffering from Chloride Stress Corrosion Cracking ... the fact that you saw failures in others using tap water ( which is typically chlorinated if it comes from a municipality or water district ) is a big clue . This is one reason that ASME specifically forbids stainless steel in the use of power boiler construction ; it is too difficult to ensure that a boiler will never receive chlorinated makeup water , or perhaps even hydro tested with chlorinated water . " Stainless Steel " is a bit of a misnomer anyway ; while it may not rust like a typical grade of steel , it is subject to corrosion given the right conditions and exposure to certain chemicals ( such as chlorine ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locomotive connecting and side rods , the properties of aluminum do n't lend itself to being used in such a high stress , demanding application that requires long-term durability . Although aluminum is sometimes used for connecting rods in high performance internal combustion engines , those are almost always in service where absolute performance is first , and longevity is secondary ( i.e. racing ) . Edit - another aluminum con rod application is in small , very low stress engines ( i.e. push mowers ) . The vast majority of IC engines continue to use rods made of ferrous materials , or perhaps titanium . I mention this because it is an interesting parallel to steam locomotive rods ; but the rods on a locomotive are subject to stresses that are many , many magnitudes over that in most IC engines , and locomotive rods are one of those things that should ideally never fail in service . The choice of most steam locomotive designers to stick with steel as the material of choice for side and connecting rods reflects the ability of steel to cope with the intense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forces exerted by centrifugal force at high speeds ) that the rods are being cycled through hundreds of times each minute . Steel is much more forgiving than aluminum when it comes to fatigue from cyclical stresses , as J Daddy pointed out . From what I can tell , that would be the primary reason that designers continued to use steel for locomotive rods instead of aluminum ; any concern about galvanic corrosion would be secondary , although that was apparently so far down the list as to not even be a worry . <p> I think it is worth noting that in " The Steam Locomotive " - a book on steam locomotive design written by Baldwin 's Chief engineer , Ralph Johnson in 1942 - there was n't any mention of non-ferrous materials for locomotive rods in the section on counterbalancing . In fact , this is the only mention of rod material choice in the book : <p> " For the maximum reduction dynamic augment every effort should be made to make the revolving and reciprocating parts as light as possible , consistent with strength requirements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quality alloy steels to keep the weights of these parts to a minimum . " <p> Also interesting , is this mention of track damage during slip testing of steam locomotives : <p> " Also it was noted that a preponderance of damage occurred on the right side . This is difficult to explain , but may be due to the right hand crank leading , or to the softer shoulder on the outside of the track . " <p> The lends some credence to the story referenced by Ace in Question #2 . <p> I believe some of the engines delivered during the war had huge rods due to the lack of good steel alloys being available . These better alloys were being used in machines of War and hence in short supply . Once the war was over then the RR 's replaced rods with lightweight alloy rods , some with roller bearings . Pretty sure I 've seen pictures of some J 's and 2900s with heavy rods . <p> Just a couple of disconnected thoughts to throw in here . 1 ) Galvanic corrosion is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trucks run in areas where road salt is used . Big aluminum brackets can " melt down " until there is almost nothing left , and just about any fastener that contacts aluminum and steel will be nearly impossible to remove after a few years . 2 ) Even if an aluminum side rod were practical strength wise , it would likely have to be SO BIG to get the proper durability that it 's size would be impractical . Aluminum connecting rods in most American V-8s barely fit in the engine block , and are generally used only in applications like drag racing where they are asked to run VERY LITTLE . As an aside , the top of the line Corvette engines have now moved on from Forged steel and then powdered metal to titanium . 3 ) Timken produces FANTASTIC steel alloys , probably on par with the best material made in this country or anywhere else in the world . That is one of the reasons Timken bearings are so good , they start with better material than most of their competitors and go from there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produced in the US , for Henry Ford circa 1905 . Magnesium is VERY flammable ( and expensive ) to the point that most racing sanctioning bodies outlaw its use in major components . Magnesium wheels can catch fire just from frictional contact with a concrete retaining wall . Stainless steel can be a very tricky material , and lacking in some respects . For instance , stainless fasteners tend not to be very strong , and relatively easy to snap in two . <p> The 1938 Loco Cyc has an advertisement on p. 603 by Alcoa . It shows an Alton and Southern 0-10-0 #14 with " aluminum rods and motion work " that " has been giving satisfactory service for over six years of operation " . With low speeds and low mileage , I regard this as a non critical application . So PRR might not have been the first . I do not know how long #14 lasted ... but suffice to say that aluminum rods were not widely used . <p> The 1938 Loco Cyc has an advertisement on p. 603 by Alcoa .

I am not well versed in how Boeing puts airplanes together , but without steel fasteners in , say , a King Air spar , you would not be airborne for long . Piston engines have cast aluminum cases held together with steel nuts and bolts , in almost all cases right through the giant Constellation engines . 175854 @qwx375854 175853 @qwx375853 <h> Block 175862 @qwx375862 
@@36015015 @5015015/ <p> Paigetrain , they do n't hate anything or anyone . " They " -- that is , the executive-level management of CSX -- have concluded that they do not desire to bear the risk and the disruption of having steam excursions on their track . It costs a railroad a lot -- more than it can recover in charges to the excursion group -- to allow steam engines to run on its tracks . Some executive-level managements are willing to allow it for the goodwill it may produce , and others are not . The public image of a railroad that allows steam is good community relations , but it costs money . This is the age-old difference between different groups of people and their thinking . When I was young , Southern Pacific and Missouri Pacific were not friendly to railfans , but Union Pacific and Santa Fe were very friendly . It is just the way things are and have always been . Now , I will agree that the personal bias of each member of management does affect the corporate policy , but it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; s the same when they buy locomotives . Both GE and EMD have good products . If you go out to buy a pickup truck , you will have to decide between , say , Ford and Chevrolet . Each is a little better than the others in certain categories , and you will weigh the differences . Then , you will decide what features are most important to you , go to a couple of competing dealers and try to make a deal . There will be a difference in the price you pay , and the incentives they will give you and you will give your business to the dealer who gives you the most in return . It 's like that when a railroad buys locomotives . GE learned from EMD that reliability is the number one consideration , and customer service is a close second . They listened harder to what the railroads liked and did not like about GE locomotives , and became as good as EMD . So , then it comes down to making the deal about how much the engine costs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very big cost to a railroad ) , and what they will do for the railroad after the locomotive is delivered . GE can often sell its locomotives at a lower price than EMD , and sometimes that 's the most important thing to a railroad . Also , they have a " field service " group of mechanical and electrical engineers who do a good job of listening to the railroad about what it likes and does not like , and help the railroad find the best ways to take care of its locomotives . EMD used to have the best field service , but GE copied them and also became excellent in that area . The railroad wants the most reliable , most fuel-efficient locomotives for the cheapest price , and both EMD and GE compete to give them that . Apparently , GE has offered better deals overall to CSX much of the time , and that accounts for the number of GE 's you see there . Also , locomotive builders like to sell a contract for a hundred or more locomotives to be delivered over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the locomotive builders time to deliver instead of forcing them to work extra shifts or overtime to get an order completed ASAP . This is old-fashioned bargaining : I 'll give you this if you 'll give me that . And , remember . . . some people like Chevrolets better than Fords , and others prefer Ford over Chevrolet . Some people own both a Ford and a Chevrolet . <p> Do n't believe everything you hear from other train enthusiasts , unless they themselves are railroad executives . It 's business , not hatred . Every railroad sees things slightly differently from others , and , really all they are doing is making decisions that they believe will help them make more money than they spend . Even railroad executives who have unpleasant personalities are only trying to make a profit for their railroad .

With the amount of this going on , I wonder if businesses can not answer even ONE of the above questions with a " yes " , and are using these relationships as a stockholder as well as tax cover .

Not likely . Maybe if we all took up a collection we could rent a boxcar and have it moved from Buffalo to Rochester . If there 's a customer out there who could benefit from rail service , they will seek out the railroad company ; giving him a ride behind Thomas the Tank Engine is n't going to sell him on the railroad 's ability to move goods economically and efficiently . <p> Is there any money to be made ?

Are there any potential customers among these railfans and passively interested folks ? Not likely . <p> All true , but not , I think , the whole picture .

If news outlets feel like people love the railroad , they might be sympathetic , or at least not hostile , in their reporting . But if the railroad is just another big , soulless corporation , then why not open fire ? Everyone likes an opportunity to bash a big , soulless corporation ! <p> Every so often you hear rumblings that railroads should be required to build bypasses around all urban areas , because of the possibility of spilling hazardous chemicals , or worse , a terrorist attack on a train . ( Being big , soulless corporations , the railroads will have plenty of money to pay for all that , of course . ) You can bet that the people pushing hard at this idea are not the ones who bring their kids to " Railroad Days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is something to be said for making an effort to control your narrative . <p> Railroads can use all the friends they can get , since they have so few of them . Every time suburbia encroaches on the railroad and its crossing whistles in the night , every time a train stops while blocking a road crossing , every time the evening news reports a hazmat or passenger train derailment , the number of friends gets smaller . <p> Thus , the steam friendliness of some railroads . Others , like CSX , wo n't deal with steam , but they all do some type of public relations or community relations activity to interact with the public in a positive setting and -- hopefully -- show their neighbors how the railroad benefits the community and the nation . <p> Thing is , nobody remembers the ride behind Thomas the Tank Engine when that horn goes off in their backyard in the middle of the night .

After that , Amtrak Genesis units powered the New River train 1995 and up . Predecessor Chessie System had two steam programs between 1977-1978 and 1980-1981 with Reading 2101 and C&amp;O 614 . Even the UP Challenger ran on CSX in the early 90 's lettered for Clinchfield . But today 's CSX wants nothing to do with steam . The 614 is sitting cold in Virginia because there 's no point in restoring it if CSX wo n't let it run on their tracks . CSX probably wants no steam excursions because of the risks and cost .

All the C railroads want nothing to do with steam right now . CSX , CN , CP . Conrail became hostile toward steam excursions in the 90 's . Steam operates on class 1 's at the whim of CEO 's and other higher ups . It boils down to the CEO 's and other decision maker 's attitudes toward steam and their views towards the risks or rewards of hosting steam excursions . <p> One does not need a steam engine to tell people that a train of X containers takes X big rig trucks off our roads , on private , tax paying ROW . <p> That message would ring with both the tree huggers AND the Tea Party in ONE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and one that CSX has made , if memory serves .

Presenting the public with one or more of these irrational reasons in favor of railroads might actually be a pretty rational thing to do . <p> The president and CEO of the American Red Cross is Gail McGovern , and her base salary has remained $500,000 " without any pay increase " since she joined the American Red Cross in 2008 .

@@36015016 @5015016/ <h> ? location of coaling and water towers <p> Wondering what is prototypical location of coaling and water towers . Were they found primarily at service depots or freight yards ? What about near passenger stations ? What about emergency stations out in the middle of nowhere ? I like to have a little of understanding of " why " and add some cause and effect backstory to my layout plans . <p> Thanks <p> George Bailey : You know what the three most exciting sounds in the world are ? Anchor chains , plane motors , and train whistles ! <p> You 'll find ash pits , sanding , coaling , and water towers adjacent to engine houses . In addition water and coaling towers would be seen and on sidings adjacent to mainlines . A water column would be found at the outer limit of a yard area . Running out of water is a lot worse than running out of coal . <p> Water columns were commonly found adjacent to passenger/freight stations . Depending upon the tender design , there was not a balance between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to replenish water before coal . That is why N&amp;W added auxiliary water tenders . <p> from my understanding , steam era operations for larger railroads were split up into divisions . at division points , crew and/or locomotive changes were made to through service . it was mostly at these stops where coaling facilities were located . <p> not only was tender water capacity depleted faster than fuel , but no engineer was going to let the tender water level get very low , so multiple water stops were typically located along the route between division points . versus coaling infrastructures , remote water facilities were also much easier to maintain and service . 175852 @qwx375852 <p> I have two tracks leading to my engine shed - on those two is a coal tipple along with a water spout and sand tower .

It is at the back corner of a shelf area that is under the edge of the eave of the house , these is barely seven inches of height avaiable to the leftmost in the photo at the backdrop 's position . the area hard to get to and harder to see to and there room for depth in any buildings here , behind the double mainline tracks .

Still , I wanted to make them look nice and it was fun to try this technique out . <p> These building fronts are printed paper on foamboard .

I cut and trimmed black foamboard to fit the area and then worked up printed building fronts , using a variety of styles . From the left : <p> The first building National Optics Inc. , I made in PowerPoint by making a brickshaped rectangle , copying it a bunch of times , building a portion of a wall by positioning them next towone another , brick-like , changed the hue of a few bricks randomly just a bit , then copying and positioned them over and over again - the result into a large brick building front .

None of them is easier or better than the others : they all work well . The final three to the right use each of those techniques again . I printed out copies on paper , measured and adjusted size , and finally printed them in color and trimmed and glued them on . . . <p> It is doubtful one will be able to see but I had fun adding so details , including outside lights , ventilators and AC units in the windows and open windows and doors and figures , etc . <p> I wanted to take my own photos of buildings , print them , and make a backdrop like that but it was hard finding a clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tinplate buildings along the back wall now . <p> Thanks for the comments guys .

Does anybody know of a source for these ? <p> You will find that the 1:48 Arttista people go very well with 1:43 cars . BTW , about 95% of the car models we have to choose from are 1:43 . Also , " O " size 6 ' tall men come in different sizes , depending on who made them . <p> Check out the Ebay auctions of the seller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for very little money . They sell 1:43.5 , 1:48 and 1:50 . The 1/50th folks look best with the typical undersized traditional Lionel trains . <p> I always thought , and continue to believe , that Arttista figures are undersized relative to 1/48 scale . A 6 ' man would scale down to 1 1/2 " and Arttista figures are smaller , sometimes considerably , than that . <p> They are great figures and look terrific as long as that 's all that you use , or at least use in a single scene . <p> It would have been nice if the die cast car market was originally established in the USA , but it was n't . It basically originated in England and 1/43 is English O'gauge and is probably derived metrically . It 's also why HO ( Half O ) is half of 1/43 , and it 1/87 instead of 1/96 . Even more interesting , 1/96 is a scale used in boat building as is 1/2 that at 1/192 . For me it 's not so much the absolute size , but whether the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I 'm thinking about building a scale model of Edward Hoppers famous painting " Night Hawks " .

I found some Super Sculpey gray heat-set clay that has more body and holds fine details better than their pink variety . My sculpting skills basically suck , but I figure if I keep trying I 'll figure it out . I sculpted some 1/16 pilots for the RC B-17 I built and they came out looking like Wallace and Gromitt , only now as funny . Here they are : <p> The pink super sculpey is so soft until you fire it that as you 're forming one feature you 're squishing the others . With the gray clay it should be better . I hope . <p> If anyone has ever sculpted their own 1:48 folks , it would nice to find out how to do it . 175854 @qwx375854 175853 @qwx375853 <h> Block 175862 @qwx375862

Is it possible then to refrain from adding more and more track , thus keeping it simple and uncluttered with a specific operation mind set and devote more space to scenery ? Or is it futile to resist the " urge " ? <p> If your layout 's size is dictated by available space , it 's more than possible -- it 's a requirement . <p> I envy you guys with room enough to worry about the possible drawbacks of a large layout . <p> In my humble opinion , if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can avoid the over proliferation of track that compromises scenery possibilities . Great layouts have a good track plan and scenery that compliments it . <p> I have tried very hard to keep myself from having too much track ! I stuck to a simple single loop with a wye in the middle of it . I have just 1 siding for an grain elevator , a 2 track siding for a locomotive shed and maintenance area and a small yard to service the great lakes car ferry . <p> Another thing I have done is cut back on the amount of buildings on the layout . I want more room for just natural scenery not a whole town that fills up the whole layout . I think that some people put way too many buildings on the layout and it just looks cluttered . <p> I am starting scenery and I feel that when I am done my tracks and trains will complement the scenery not over run it . <p> If you want realistic scenic oppurtunity and you did n't have a plan going in you 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm not a planner and never will be . I 've spent much of the last few weeks removing track to simplify things . I discovered O scale takes a lot of room to look real when I started with mountains , trees and water . Fortunately I was able to correct some of my problems early on before I really got into the scenery . I had a siding or a spur at nearly every turn as if the whole room was a massive yard . That 's works if that 's how you wish to enjoy the hobby . On the other hand , try to get a road in there somewhere with all that track . Roads are almost the last thing you think about when laying track and it should be planned with the track design for things to work well scenically . <p> Yes it can happen , especially after breaking down a large layout . In my case , the last 4 years have been no more than 2 ovals of different track on a 4x8 Christmas layout . I do plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small addition to the FasTrack oval . However I do not plan another big layout for some time . It does take self discipline to keep from expanding a small layout , especially for a guy like me who loves to build layouts . <p> PCRR/Dave <p> The little Christmas layout . 175857 @qwx375857 <p> Yes , it 's possible if its what you want . It think I have done it . I know how and where I could add another complete train loop and up to perhaps another 100 feet of track or ' Streets , as well as several sidings and such for even more , but in my case it would be at the expense of an " empty " open-country look I have in much of my layout , and I just wo n't go there . <p> On the other hand I have seen photo-layouts of , and have several friends with , layouts that are bursting at the seams : there is track everywhere , and every square inch they can not get track into is covered with buildings , roads , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left at all ! It is truly amazing how much is crammed in some of these layouts . To me it seems almost claustrophobic , just too crowded , but the owners like it - and that is fine with me . But I wo n't be going there , or even a step in that direction . <p> I have a 16 ' by 27 ' shop that will host an around the wall shelf layout so as to leave room in the middle for shop space . The bench work is up , open grid at 48 " high . Width varies from 24 " to 18 " and will have an 8 ' lift out across the shop door . I am thinking a simple oval at 54 " and a point to point switching line at 48 " . Simple and doable , then go big with scenery . <p> While I ca n't speak for others , I can say that my first BIG mistake was in trying to get in as much track as possible . Admittedly it was great fun planning it that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a big mistake . First , it overly complicated running trains thereby taking some of the fun away . But for me the biggest problem with too much track is that it takes so much scenery/structure opportunities away . After seeing so many great layouts in OGR magazine , meets , etc I always walk away being impressed not so much by the expansive track but by the specific scenes around the layout . Even though I do n't have a large space I do have enough to make some interesting scenes . <p> In fact I might actually make one more " track downsizing " to give me more places to make some fun scenes . <p> As they say less is often better . I think that especially is true for track and model train layouts . <p> This thread really hits home right now . My first O gauge layout effort was with a small , 3 ft. by 11 ft table , which turned out very well ( see OGR run 220 ) . An addition to my home was planned , so I dedicated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new , expanded layout . I wanted to place as much track on it as I could . Several dozen track plans later , I settled on a design that was like a folded dogbone with two mainlines that had 2 reverse loops , sidings , even a storage yard tucked behind the door . The plywood topped table was soon built , track laid , and trains were running . To me , it was a dream come true - track everywhere , so many route possibilities , with the ability to park all of my engines on the rails and still keep the mainlines clear . <p> As I began to plan the landscaping , I soon realized the flaw in my design . I enjoy the scenic side of a layout as much as track designs , but after staring at this layout for hours and hours , I could n't find a spot large enough to place a town or a house or an industry . Furthermore , I wanted a stream or creek , and roads , and maybe a mountain in the corner . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a railroad track before I finished the placement . The layout was also against two walls , which prevented me from being able to enjoy the trains on an eye level straightaway . I finally decided that , although the design was great for running trains , I was retired and now had more time to devote to the train room , so new track plans began to fly . This time , smaller would be better , and I addressed all the shortcomings the old layout had . <p> Tearing down the old and putting up the new took about 2 weeks . The table is finished , and now it 's time to lay down tracks . I still have second thoughts about reducing track mileage , but it 's melting day by day as I think of the many other opportunities I now have to expand my enjoyment of model railroading. 175852 @qwx375852 <p> Stay tuned ............. my layout was the cover story in Run 255 in 2012 . It is now being dismantled and will be replaced with a much bigger layout but with a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Don , so I can make it the cover feature again in a future issuehopefully a near future issue ! <p> I 'm in the process of reconfiguring my own modest-size home layout , and even though the current track plan ( FasTrack ) is not what I would call a spaghetti bowl design , the new one ( using GarGraves track and Ross switches ) will be even further simplified to make space for more scenic elements . I envision it to have one main line , one long passing siding , one shorter passing siding , a small number of yard tracks , and perhaps a couple of industry spurs . <p> Unlike many or most , I do n't do a whole lot of advance track planning with computer software , drafting paper , or that sort of thing . I just start putting down and arranging track until I come up with something that pleases me . Since I use ( primarily ) sectional track , that 's pretty easy to do and I find it to be a lot of fun . Once I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ location ; put down roadbed ; and then proceed with ballasting , placement of accessories , and scenery work . <p> Basic for me : Outer loop , reversing loop , and a wye . Spent too much time as a kid lamenting my trains going in only one direction . Also , a majority of layout plans have a reverse loop that can only be accessed in one direction . Once you use that kind of reverse loop you are stuck with the second direction . <p> I have seen huge layouts that never seem to ever get finished or after the track gets installed that is all that ever happens . I love the large layouts I see here , but sometimes it is apparent that some do n't realize how big the project until they are knee deep in it . <p> At 6x12 there was plenty to do , just thankfully I had built a layout and before that a couple uncompleted HO layouts . <p> Having a smaller layout can get boring if all the trains do is go around in circles without the ability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ layouts no smaller than 6x12 but not much larger either and what I do know is that people that see layouts really like detailed scenery ; so the solution lies in how can you make a layout with enough track variety and detailed scenery - balance . And once you add command control the desire to have more complex track operations is very desirable . <p> Allan Miller 's approach to layout building is a mirror image of my own . I just like to " wing-it " and see what pleases me in the end . I think I 've done a respectable job of keeping the track to scenery ratio in balance on my latest retirement layout . <p> My latest layout was the result of wanting to keep my Atlas " O " 7.5 degree turnouts and an 0-99 outer loop in a 11 X 14 foot space . Min radius came in at 0-72 ( due to two half sections + one 0-72 turnout on the 0-90 &amp; 0-81 passing tracks ) . <p> An early ( disappointing ) lesson I learned in O is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of scenery and many buildings on the same layout . Since I really like mountains and running trains , the buildings had to go : I have only about a dozen on my 8 ' 8 " X 15 ' 3 " very irregularly-shaped layout . But I managed to make three runs of track , none of them pure ovals . I 'm happy . <p> I think too much track for the layout size can be traced to : The layout plans by the " experts " that can be found online ( spaghetti anyone ? ) , and the idea that you can have endless hours of " operating " fun . On my 5x8 I have 2 loops , one siding , and enough scenics to keep visiters happy for at least 15 minutes . <p> Those who may be interested in seeing what can be done with a far more realistic track configuration and the possibilities it affords might want to check out this thread in the Layout Design forum . It follows the ongoing development of a layout from conception to execution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A fine learning guide for the inexperienced as well as the more experienced . <p> I think most would agree that when it comes to creating a convincing " world in miniature " in O gauge , Norm Charbonneau ranks right up there with the very best . <p> When you follow prototype practice and have an interchange , engine servicing , Industries freight yard etc it can get crowded fast and all the while you want to give the impression of going somewhere distant while if it the space available is typical , you will be lucky to leave the yard or quickly loop around it . <p> So that was crossed that scenario from my list . Then there 's little room for buildings as well . Everything is compromise and compression while giving that sense of having more space between things .. <p> Less is more .. in that sense if " realism " is wanted or needed . Even at that , given a finite amount of space I gave up on a formal plan and kept tinkering with placement as to see what it looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good on paper .. sometimes even often comes out way different ( often in operating dissatisfaction ) than imagined on a plan . I suppose it comes down to not being able to consider everything in relation to one another as an abstraction . <p> Have n't finished the initial 5 x 8 display yet and discovered I could probably fit 4 more loops on the bottom shelves . Will I resist the urge ? <p> I like this and would be interested in seeing the final " product " . My own layout is really simply a backdrop to the trains rather than the trains being a backdrop for the scenery . This configuration reminds me of going to Field 's Department store in Chicago 's loop to see the Christmas display and my own followed this cue as well . With three loops and two bump and go sections the action is both hypnotic and relaxing . Great design ! <p> I think there are multiple schools of thought when planning a layout . Some opt for lots of track in the post war display layout tradition . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the actors . Neither is wrong since this is a hobby after all and the end result should be do we enjoy what we do . I have moved to the less is more camp but that does n't mean that view is better or worse than others . My layout , due to space constraints is a long narrow single track affair with a junction leading to return loops at each end . At scale speed it can take about 2 to 3 minutes to run the full length in each direction . A trolley loop and a back and forth mine shifter complete the action . That is enough for me to manage . <p> Small around the room layout with a wye track for reversing engines and trains . <p> Here is a small " around the room design " . It provides for continuous operation while allowing for some simple switching maneuvers . The wye track is used with an " island " stub yard to allow reversing of an engine . The layout uses O-54 and O-72 curves but a more compact layout could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uses " narrow " benchwork . Most sections are about 18 inches wide which make access to the tracks within arms reach . The largest section is about 3 feet by 6 feet . <p> For me , I turn to my experience ( and track plans ) in HO . HO is where I started in the hobby and they seem the have the right amount of track to scenery ratio . I was able to scale up an Atlas track plan ( Granite Gorge and Northern ) that I did n't have enough space to build as a kid , but have plenty of space to build it in O-gauge now . <p> I would recommend looking at track plans in other scales and adopting what works for you in O-gauge . <p> When I used to play on my grandmothers living room floor with a Marx " Big Rail Work Train " I could only dream of a layout with interconnected loops and sidings and more than one train running at a time . <p> I achieved that dream 10 years ago when I built this layout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was only able to fit a 12x8 table along the back wall . My LHS where at the time I was making most of my purchases was more than accommodating and let me buy all the track I wanted with the understanding I could return whatever I did n't use.I bought a little over 800.00 dollars worth of MTH track brought it home dumped it on the table and fiddled with it for a few hours until I had what I wanted and I ended up returning about 60.00 worth of track . <p> As you can see I have no interest in scenery or real train type operations but this layout has kept me more than occupied and its a long ways away from my grandmothers living room floor . <p> From here on out Ihave a loop , circle , whatever of track with no switches or crossings . Seems like everybody has an engine or car which does not like thase kinds of track for whatever reason : flanges , gears , 3rd rail shoes , et . al . <p> I did plan my front of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Station , where I spent a lot of nights connecting between the TX CHIEF and SUPER CHIEF ? EL CAP . <p> I have used a metal 2x6 to span an 8 foot area . The metal is 10 feet long and spans about 8 feet and rests on about 1 foot of layout on each side of the bridge . Works fine as a temporary solution . Will probably cut a 2x4 to place vertically in the middle for additional support . Got to spend some time figuring out how to dress the structure up . Has to be removeable as it goes across a double door leading from the basement to the outside . 175854 @qwx375854 175853 @qwx375853 <h> Block 175862 @qwx375862

It is not scale but they have the scale ones in the premier section and the difference is 7/8 " or 3 1/2 " scale in length longer on the scale one . The scale one also has 6 axles and 3 hooks .

I 'm looking for some imput from those that have them or a Lionel one and how , what , where do you use them ? I thank all of you in advance for your replies . <p> I would not assume that the RailKing cranes are not scale-sized , unless of course you know that for sure . The ones you are referring to in the 2014 MTH catalog are representations of an " American " crane , which in real life was a smaller , lighter-duty crane . The Premier ones you referenced are models of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ larger , heavier-duty crane . <p> If you care about remaining true to the prototype , you can do some research to see if the Milwaukee Road owned one or both types of cranes , and then make your purchase decision based on that . I do n't know very much about the MR , but a very quick web search found the following photo , so it looks like they owned an Industrial Brownhoist crane ... <p> If the MR owned both types , think about what " work " your crane will be doing on your layout , and go from there . If they did not own both types , or you do n't care about being accurate , you can always buy both ! ! 175852 @qwx375852 <p> The Rail King crane is quite large and , as Joe says , may well be scale . I do n't have the prototype dimensions but it is certainly big enough to be credible in a scale size work train . I have a previous version in Milwaukee Road paint , as well as the Premier crane in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Another issue is whether you want the tender or just the crane . I have never seen a photo of a tender like that on the Milwaukee Road . The photos I have seen show flatcars filled with work train supplies , wheels , etc. used as idlers under the boom . The Milwaukee used old boxcars and passenger cars as tool cars and crew cars . If you do not have them , you should get both volumes of the Nighswonger/Morning Sun book , " Milwaukee Road Color Guide to Freight and Passenger Equipment . " Volume 1 is passenger and non-revenue equipment , including work trains . Volume 2 is revenue freight cars . Volume 1 has pictures of several Milwaukee Road cranes . The American crane as such is not shown , but there is a " burro " ( self-propelled ) crane very similar in appearance . There are also photos of a 100-ton crane like the MTH Premier version .

@@36015027 @5015027/ <h> Masking and Painting Trains <p> I tried posting part of this in another topic a few days ago , but the topic had about run its course , so I thought I 'd give it a try as a standalone topic . <p> A number of forum members have been very generous with their time and knowledge in explaining their techniques and posting photo examples for custom painting trains . Lee Willis and AMCDave in particular have made some recent posts with very good information for the beginning train painter . Thanks to all for taking the time to share your experience . I 'm beginning to understand the process . I 'm thinking up a paint scheme I 'd like to use some day to paint some engines for my private toy train railroad . It has multiple colors and I 'm wondering about the best way to paint a locomotive if you are going to paint more than one color . I 'm hoping some forum members can discuss the thought process and techniques they use for painting additional colors on a locomotive . <p> For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have primed the shell and are ready to paint the primary colors , how do you tend to decide to : <p> 1 ) tape off areas for painting separate colors directly on the primer coat , or <p> 2 ) spray one color , then tape and spray the second color , that on part of the shell , goes on top of the first color ? <p> For example on Lee Willis ' topic on his Santa Fe locomotives , it looks like Lee used both methods . It looks like the cab ( to be painted red ) was masked off when the silver was painted , but on the tender , everything was painted silver , and then the red paint on the bottom section was painted on top of the silver paint . Here are 2 photos I borrowed from Lee 's topic . <p> Dave , on the CSX engine shown below ( photo borrowed from Dave 's post ) , for the grey , blue , and yellow colors , in what order did you mask and paint ? <p> With no practical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a real pain to do , so choosing a paint sequence that reduces the amount of taping might be beneficial , or do you want to minimize the layers of paint where colors are painted over other colors ? <p> It seems to be both a science and an art . Thanks for any help and advice . <p> Very quickly : is a Zebra black with white stripes or the other way around ? I think biologists say out it is white with black stripes : but mypoint is - sometimes it just does n't matter that much . It would be just as hard to paint either way . <p> Most important point : I am happy to share my experience . I do know what I am doing , but that does not mean what I am doing things in the best possible way . Maybe there is a better way -probably . It 's just the way I do it , a way so far has not bitten me badly enough that I give it up ! <p> Another point : I paint the entire loco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ATSF loco that picture you used , that was silver : In the case of the N&amp;W J I painted in UP greyhound ( photo below ) , I covered everything I painted in gray ( except for the black on top , which is the original color as Lionel made it , which I masked from everything including primer because I was going to keep that black ) . Anyway , when the gray was dry and hard , I then masked what I wanted to stay gray and sprayed the yellow on top of gray , etc . <p> Of course there is another way to do it : a person could mask off and paint only those portions that will remain gray all the way to the end , covering and leaving the primer in the places where the yellow will eventually be on . Then after the gray dries , mask it and apply the yellow over primer . Might be better , except I do not do that , reason being I have found it impossible to exactly match the masking lines a second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sliver of the wrong color that shows , etc ) . Or think of it this way : it 's just how I do things . <p> I tend normally to do colors in lightest to darkest : On the UP J , that was gray , thenn yellow . On the ATSF loco that would be silver , yellow , red , black . I do this because my experience is that light paints often change color a bit when applied over dark , but not as much the other way around . However , there is so little yellow that I did it last ( the black will be pinstriping tape , it is too narrow in my judgement for me to get the scale stripe perfectly even thickness ) . I also did the yellow last because I felt it was the key to the entire loco 's look ( I 'm pretty sure I am right about that , and I wanted the red in place before I decided exactly how to curve its lines . <p> I use the blue 3M painters tape for most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tape for all edges : I put it on first and carefully , tracing exactly where I want the transition from one to the other color to be , then come back with the blue over that tape to cover the bulk of the loco .

It looked black and white on the site where I bought it but it was blue and white when it arrived today . Now it is black and white . This afternoon I used the green 1/4 tape to follow the edges of the white doors and such and the sprayed it about two hours ago ( I painted it in exactly the same color scheme it was : all the white you see is the original white from White Rose , and where it is black , it was blue ) . The green tape followed door seams and all very well - as you can see - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line than the blue masking does .

But , here is a rendering of the paint scheme I 've developed for my private toy train railroad ( colors added to an original drawing of the GP38 by Michael Eby ) . It would be a repaint of a Williams GP38 . It is probably going to be a while before I have a chance to attempt the painting . Based on your info , I think I 'd prime it with a gray primer , paint the red as the base color , then the green , and then the silver .

@@36015028 @5015028/ <p> Let 's assume you mean the distance between the locomotive and tender . Back in the day when 027 curves were one of two choices , and by far the most popular ... you had to accommodate the two coupled units backing up and even backing through " S " curves . I 've seen pre-war Lionel where the loco and tender were way too far apart , even with the above considerations . Perhaps it was figured that tiny hands would have an easier time getting the two pieces together with oodles of room to play with . And yes , it looks positively horrible ! On my 736 , it was possible to substitute the older 726 drawbar to get a closer fit ; other times it meant adding a new slot to the locomotive tongue , so the tender could ride closer . Even did something like this on my 1990 Lionel 700E . My other pet peeve is N gauge sized pilot wheels on O gauge steamers . I understand the issue here , but notching the cylinders in the rear would produce a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my locos to have much closer coupling than from the factory , determining it so that it is exactly as on the prototype , or if I ca n't get that , then as narrow as can be with just room enough that tender and loco body do n't meet in 72 " if is a 72 " only loco or 60 " if its a loco I will run on the other loops . <p> Lionel 's new self adjusting draw bar on their S-3 has a rather clever device that brings the engine and tender close together when it 's on straight track and as it enters a curve , that distance actually increases to compensate for our overly tight curves . I 'm assuming that all of their Legacy vision locomotives will now incorporate this feature . <p> To draw a tender right up to the buffers it takes really broad curves .

Say I want to run an RK loco on nothing smaller than O-60 : most of them have quite a big gap so they will run on tight , tight , curves , so I can shorten the gap a lot . I set up the O-60 track and check it frequently as I am making the new , shorter drawbar , so it is just long enough . <p> In many cases I have found it easiest to make a new piece from scratch , rather than actually modify the old piece . <p> To me , the easiest cases are when you can shorten what you need while working on only one side or the other - only the loco side of the coupling and leave the tender alone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult is when you have to modify both . This increases difficulty for two reasons : a ) the obvious reason is that you have to work on both pieces , which means twice as much disassembly and a lot of care in coordinating the adjustments you make to both pieces , b ) the non-obvious reason is that there is usually a reason - clearance , room to swing , or something else - that precludes just working on one side alone , and that reason will often be a pain in the butt to work around . <p> On Legacy locos , to make any meaningful reduction in gap you often have to relocate at least one side of the IR coupler : its right up there at the middle of the gap and if you want to shorten the gap . . . I really do n't like fiddling with it but I have never ruined one - just have to be careful - I never cut or shorten the wires to the IR thingees but instead take it loose , move it and reattached it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the **28;556;TOOLONG up farther into the tender or loco as the case may be , or out of the way so that they wo n't snag anything . <p> On recent MTH locos , with the square vertical connector that fits through the squaqre hole and clips to form the coupling , there is a lot of **30;586;TOOLONG work do be done . I do n't like doing these at all . One o fthe locos I decided not to do was a RK 0-6-0 I had , I just left alone . <p> Real steam locomotives do NOT have couplers between the engine and tender ! If couplers were used , there would be slack action between the two components and THAT can NOT be allowed . On real steam locomotives the tender MUST be drawn-up TIGHT to the large spring loaded buffer assembly under the cab apron . <p> That is why there are two VERY thick solid steel drawbars between the tender and engine ; one is the actual " pulling drawbar " , while the second one is the " safety drawbar " .

It already came with two holes , one for operation and one for display , I think if I remember the manual right . Either way I have O48 track on the floor now and it runs just fine in the display hole . If I want to go closer , I just drill a new hole and I 'm done .

This is also a production Q , so who knows what is really going on ... other than making the Locomotive easier to access and move . <p> As Fisch pointed out , the Lionel drawbar mechanism on the S3 Northern brings the tender in close and still allows the locomotive to navigate relatively tight curves ( I think the S3 is rated for 0-54 , which is typical for a scale Northern ) .

@@36015029 @5015029/ <h> Rotary switch and turntable wiring <p> I have an Atlas 0 turntable and 6 stub tracks . Currently each of the stubs is wired using a DPDT switch which turns on pwr to the stub as well as changing the red/green color of an led . <p> I am redoing the control panel and rather than individual switches i want to use a multi position rotary switch for the stubs . <p> My question is about the rotary switch . If I turn the switch say from position 1 to position 5 , wo n't the switch briefly supply power to positions 2-4 as I turn the switch ? If that 's the case then I would n't think that is good for the locos on the stubs to get a brief shot of power every time I cycle past each position . <p> I am sure there must be a very simple solution for this but since I have never been accused of being an electrical genius I would appreciate any ideas . <p> Thank you for all the good information and the variety of solutions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see which one makes sense for me to implement . <p> Stan - you talked about a 1 second delay relay . That seems like it should be long enough to cycle thru the positions . Just as an FYI for me , can you also get them with a little longer delay , ie 2 seconds ? <p> Jack - the break before make rotary switch also sounds like it would do the job . Pardon me for asking what is probably a simple question . I am not quite sure how the break before make rotary works . Is there some delay between the break and make . I guess my real question is how it works when you cycle thru the positions , ie will it prevent power going to each of the tracks as you cycle to the desired position . <p> Make-before-break has a switched contact that bridges two adjacent fixed contacts , so that power is fed , momentarily , to the one being turned off and the one being turned on , at the same time . <p> Break-before-make has a switched contact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no feedback between the adjacent circuits . <p> The method of a master switch in series with the main feed , left OFF while switching among tracks , is the easiest and cheapest solution . If you proceed with that scheme , the make/break question on the rotary switch is not an issue . <p> Both the individual switches on each stall and a rotary to switch on only one track at a time have advantages depending on your type of control system . <p> For command control 1 switch to turn on all stalls at once works great on a TMCC Legacy or DCS or DCC ( HO ) systems as long as no conventional engines are on any of the tracks . With conventional engines some engines will end up in the pit . <p> A Rotary that turns on only one track at a time works best with conventional engines but not as well with TMCC , Legacy DCS since you only have one engine powered up at a time . For TMCC Legacy and DCS you ca n't have multiple engines fired up at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stall you can power up one , none , all or just a few which works great with conventional or command control systems . <p> I inherited an HOn3 layout with the turntable wired for DCC so that one switch powered up all stalls at once . This did n't work to well with conventional DC brass engines when they all ended up in the pit . I rewired it so the engine house power switch powered up the rotary switch which worked great for my conventional engines . Now I 've converted to DCC and will have to remove the rotary and install individual switches on each stall . <p> If someone uses the lighted rocker switches like the Caltron brand , which mounts in a round hole , they can run a common wire to all the earth negative terminals and connect that thru a diode pointing to , and connected to the U terminal of their track supply . Since the LEDs only conduct for a half cycle the average voltage on them is then less than 12 vdc . And the diode will protect the LEDs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cycle . This works for me for a number of years . <p> If you do use rotary switch , check that its contacts can handle 1-2 amps continuous current . Alot of rotary switches are designed for light duty signal handling and might handle heavier current a few times before combined contact resistance and current heats the contacts so they lose their tension and become intermittent . And/or the light weight contacts pit and burn as connection is made and broken . <p> Stan - you talked about a 1 second delay relay . That seems like it should be long enough to cycle thru the positions . Just as an FYI for me , can you also get them with a little longer delay , ie 2 seconds ? <p> ... You can buy relays or relay modules with built-in time-delays but these would increase total cost by 10x or more . <p> Well , here I 'm quoting myself but in another thread a $2 ( eBay ) relay module with turn-on delay was just discussed . So IF going with the relay method , the intermittent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modules . The turn-on delay is set with a screwdriver adjustment . So the configuration is as shown below which allows a low-current rotary switch which might save on cost and provide more selection of styles . I also see the terms " shorting " and " non-shorting " are alternately used to describe make-before-break and break-before-make . In any case , with the relay method using time-delay , either switch type is OK without the need for the toggle switch . 175854 @qwx375854 175853 @qwx375853 <h> Block 175862 @qwx375862 
@@36015030 @5015030/ <h> LED 's and Continuity testing <p> Ok , not specifically train related but the information and answers will be . <p> My 3rd bake light on my vehicle was not working . It is a sealed 8 inch bar of LED 's . I got out the old Radio Shack multimeter and tried to test for continuity . The needle did not move so I figured something inside was damaged and ordered a new 3rd Brake light assembly . <p> I tested the new replacement and there was no continuity either , however once installed it lighted just fine . <p> Why would the continuity test not register for the new working light ? Is this the nature of LED 's such that this is not an appropriate test or ( most likely ) operator error ? <p> AN LED or diode will conduct ( and light in the case of the LED ) in one direction and not the other . Best test for an LED is a 1.5V-3V battery . 1.5 will light a red , 3V will light a white . <p> Dale H <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was because the LED uses arcing to light and therefor does n't have continuity all the way thru to the other lead like an incandescent bulb . So the only way to tell if an LED works or not is if it works .. or not ? Makes sense it 's really hard to look at one and see if it 's bad . <p> To test a diode , you apply a fixed current from a current source and measure the voltage drop across the diode . This is what the " diode " setting on a volt/ohm meter does . Unfortunately , if you have diodes that take higher voltages , like white LEDs or series-connected non-white LEDs , the meter may not have enough voltage behind the current source to get a reading . <p> Also remember that these LEDS are most likely wired in series . Probably 4 or 5 wired in series so each lamp gets about 2.2V ( assuming nominal 13.8V battery ) . And speculate there is probably a simple constant current source circuit to maintain steady brightness regardless of auto battery supply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you took the bar apart you could test each LED until the bad one is found , assuming the constant current circuit had not failed . <p> Relatively easy . You will need the specs on the LED 's you plan on using . They have voltage and current limits which are unforgiving . Exceed a limit and the LED burns out like a fuse . A LED is simply a diode , a rectifier which happens to give off light when it is forward biased and is conducting current . Your problem is one of voltage and current . Too much of either and teh diode burns out like a fuse . A typical led strip lights forward biases at something over 0.5 volts , and can usually tolerate about 10-30 milliamperes ( MA ) of current . If we These are rated in milliwatts ( MW ) of heat dissapation . A typical flexible led strip ( the kind which is about 0.2 inch diameter and about 0.3 inch long ) can dissapate about 10 MW , which means I have to adjust current and voltage according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resistence , and P=IE , power equals current times voltage . 10 MW means I can have 10 MA and 1 volt across the diode , 5 MA and 2 V , or any combination which does not exceed any of the rated limits . So , how do you get this ? Use a stepdown transformer as working with the power line directly is VERY VERY DANGEROUS . Any wall wart style will do . Radio Shack and several other electronics stores will have these at a reasonable cost . Look for one with about a 6 volt DC output . With the example of the 1 volt drop and 10 MA current , you should be able to connect 6 of these in series ( anode to cathode , anode to cathode , just like batteries in series ) and connect them directly across the 6 VDC supply and they all should light . If it is n't bright enough ( as I am being quite conservative in my estimates ) , you might be able to remove one LED from the string to up the current ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a meter capable of measuring MA to monitor the current drawn by the string . By using a transformer to lower the voltage you use as a power source , this means you can parallel a rechargeable battery downstream of the transformer to supply power to keep the LED Light Bars when the power line fails . This is how a lot of emergency lights in buildings work these days . The low voatage power supply lights the lights and keeps the battery charged and if the power line fails , the battery keeps the lights lit . You will need to do more research on how to add the backup battery since there is not room here to give much in the way of detail here to charge the battery and keep it in good health ( overcharging is the cause of early failure of standby batteries ) . Using a combination of strings in series and parallel up to the current capacity of the power supply will determine your end result . I am only giving a basic outline here since I am not legally going to allow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stupid which gets you killed working with the power line drectly . Again I say , DO NOT WORK WITH THE POWER LINE DIRECTLY ! ALWAYS use a stepdown transformer to protect yourself from becoming a crispy critter and NEVER assume a circuit is dead until you verify it is really deenergized . You can DIE and there is no coming back from death as we know it . <p> Thanks to everyone for your input . My meter is pretty old school analog about 20 years old so I did not see a diode setting ( but not sure what the symbols would be for that ) . I tried the cotinunity test both ways on the LED terminals ( old and new working light ) and no needle movement . The meter had a new 9 volt battry but it sound as tough that may not have had enough power to make the test work ? ? <p> Out of curiosity , I will try to dis-assemble the sealed unit to see what may have caused the issue . ( BTW the dealer wanted $220 for a replacement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To complicate the issue , the fuse was also blown . Perhaps an internal short in the old light could have caused that ? ? <p> ( If you own a GM Suburban be forewarned there are 3 separate fuse panels and the 3rd brake light is fused in a different fuse block than the regular stop lights .

If it is n't bright enough ( as I am being quite conservative in my estimates ) , you might be able to remove one LED from the string to up the current ( light output ) without exceeding the current limits . Use a meter capable of measuring MA to monitor the current drawn by the string . By using a transformer to lower the voltage you use as a power source , this means you can parallel a rechargeable battery downstream of the transformer to supply power to keep the LED Light Bars when the power line fails . This is how a lot of emergency lights in buildings work these days . The low voatage power supply lights the lights and keeps the battery charged and if the power line fails , the battery keeps the lights lit . You will need to do more research on how to add the backup battery since there is not room here to give much in the way of detail here to charge the battery and keep it in good health ( overcharging is the cause of early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strings in series and parallel up to the current capacity of the power supply will determine your end result . I am only giving a basic outline here since I am not legally going to allow myself to be obligated in the event you do something stupid which gets you killed working with the power line drectly . Again I say , DO NOT WORK WITH THE POWER LINE DIRECTLY ! ALWAYS use a stepdown transformer to protect yourself from becoming a crispy critter and NEVER assume a circuit is dead until you verify it is really deenergized . You can DIE and there is no coming back from death as we know it . <p> If doing a lot of these , I would make up a test board with a CL2-N3 chip . That way only 20ma would go to the LED regardless of voltage input . This assumes testing an LED on a circuit in which all power is off and secured . <p> The meter had a new 9 volt battry but it sound as tough that may not have had enough power to make the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your meter could apply to the module whether in resistance-mode or diode-mode ( if it has it ) is 9V . Since diodes are the principal load inside , the resistance ( measured indirectly by voltage divided by current ) changes with voltage and drops dramatically as you approach 12V and the LEDs start to turn on . That is , I think you were not applying enough test-voltage . <p> Even when you get inside and attempt to measure individual LEDs , it may be tricky . It appears you have a " needle " analog meter presumably the kind with selectable resistance ranges such as Rx1 , Rx10 , etc . Some analog meters put out a hefty test-current when in the Rx1 range which might pop a traditional 20-mA LED . <p> Well I have to agree with john . All you need is a 9 volt battery and a 500 ohm or better resistor . I keep a set of jumpers around with alligator clips on both ends . A set of red ones and a set of black ones . stick a resistor in line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the + side of the battery a black jumper and go to the common side of the LED and the - side of the battery .... simple . I do this anyway when I make my own LED 's to use in my engines and buildings . No use putting something in that does n't work . 175854 @qwx375854 175853 @qwx375853 <h> Block 175862 @qwx375862 
@@36015033 @5015033/ <p> I have both scale versions . One Pacific and two Mikados . I think the Mikados are may favorite steamers . Great size and detail .

I guess then i need to search for a semi scale mike ... i see quite a few scale k line mikes but no semi scale.Thanks guys ... <p> I have semi scale ( Western Pacific ) and scale ( NYC ) Mikes . The semi scale engine is about 10% smaller compared to the prototype . I have n't measured the scale engine but assume its close to full 1/48 .

From scale front coupler to tender coupler is 22 inches . Now there are two drawbar holes so if you use the longer one it will make the engine and tender a little longer .

Have n't checked actual dimensions but it looks right to me . <p> I also added TMCC and EOB to the engine and run it regularly in the passenger fleet .

@@36015036 @5015036/ <h> MERKUR tubular track and points <p> It is a while ago I have written on this forum about the tubular tinplate track of MERKUR the Czech model train producer . <p> In the last years mainly people in the UK were asking for tubular track compatible with the old Hornby and Lionel tubular track . MERKUR developed the 072 , 060 and 048 points ( switches ) , just like they offer their curved track . To gain more space on your lay out the lever handle plate may be mounted on the right or the left side of the point ! <p> The track system of MERKUR is growing . New in their program are the crossings of 22,5 , 45 and 90 degrees , and new points are introduced electronically operated by a servo motor . After my visit at MERKUR in summer 2014 they even decided to produce long track , 900 mm ! I will receive my first batch when MERKUR visits Holland next week . <p> If you like to have more information just send an email or reply to this topic . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for your question . My partner Bruce palmer wrote on a forum where people say there will be an issue in delering LIONEL tubular track the next : <p> " Graeme described the situation here in the UK about tubular track and mentioned the Merkur track system . I import this into the UK and it is a excellent product the track seems to be very close to a copy of modern Chinese made Lionel but the points/switches are very similar to British Hornby , but better engineered ! <p> They have the advantage that they come in 072 , 060 and 048 and are *universal * with a moving plate so do n't have all the unreliability problems of Lionel 072 . Being European they are basically hand operated but an electrically operated version is just being introduced as I deal with them they are also cheap " <p> People in the UK who have old HORNBY , old and new LIONEL and so on are very pleased with the points of MERKUR . I have some experiences with old M+rklin , Darstaed and ETS . It really drives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I post a picture of a drawing of it . I 'll meet the CEO of MERKUR in Holland next week and I 'll ask him when the crossings are ready . <p> Shipment to the US till 2kg G 24,30 , till 5kg G 34,30 , till 10kg G 58,30 . When I know the exact weight of the parcel I am able to calculate the correct price . All will be sent by Dutch post . Means a quicker customs handling and no charge for that . <p> The manual point is 0,25 kg . The e point will be some heavier about 0,275 . <p> MERKUR produce and design their own track . Because there was a demand for points in the UK MERKUR decided to produce more switches/points . I think I am able to convince MERKUR to produce a different switch if the market asked for . However the # 4 switch is in cm or inch ? I am sorry but English is not my mother language ..... And sometimes when it becomes too technical I need some help with the translation . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cm or inches . The main difference between a #4 switch / point and an O-72 is that the turnout portion comes out straight , instead of at a curve like the O-72 . The advantage to this is you can fit more tracks in the same amount of space using a #4 than you can using an O-72 switch / point . Other companies make O-72 and #4 switches , but as I 've learned recently , they 're not compatible with all Lionel tinplate trains . <p> Thanks . I will do some research . MERKUR has solved the space issue . The operation lever plate of the 760 and 900 mm switches/points may be mounted on the left or the right hand side of the switch/point . <p> In one of my topics I have given the webadress of a blog about lionel . This gentleman has a lot of experience with Lionel and MERKUR track . In the UK they expierenced the same issues . People tell me their old locomotives and long wagons run smooth over the MERKUR points/switches. 175852 @qwx375852 <p> Are these switches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gears and flanges ? If so , I 'd love more info on them . <p> Thanks ! ! <p> John <p> I read that blog that RobG posted the link to , and the fellow said he measured his prewar Lionel flanges , and they were the same size as the Merkur tinplate trains . He was runiinig prewar as well as modern US O gauge , and European tinplate through the Merkur track without problems . Sounds pretty promising . Nice variety of sizes too . <p> MERKUR produce and design their own track . Because there was a demand for points in the UK MERKUR decided to produce more switches/points . I think I am able to convince MERKUR to produce a different switch if the market asked for . However the # 4 switch is in cm or inch ? I am sorry but English is not my mother language ..... And sometimes when it becomes too technical I need some help with the translation . <p> Rob <p> The #4 is actually a real US railway designation of a switch size . As the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a curve , the turn is accomplished completely within the frog ( movable section ) . This allows closer spacing of parallel rail lines than any curved Switch/point . Hope that helps explain what he was looking for .

@@36015037 @5015037/ <h> what 's the best o guage track and transformer <p> what track can I use on all my lionel , I have locos from the 30 to the 90s , , i want it to look not so wimsey and not expensive fast track is crazy amount of money ........ and the same for my transformer able to run locos from 30 to modern <p> There is no " best " choice of track , or , for that matter , of transformer . There are many choices out there , ranging from FasTrack and RealTrax ( both of which which apparently do n't interest you due to cost ) , to traditional tubular ( Lionel and others ) , to GarGraves and Ross ( tubular , but enhanced with ties ) , to Atlas ( solid rail ) , and others . <p> It 's strictly a matter of individual choice , budget , and availability/variety , I suppose . I say " I suppose " because I look at track as a one-time lifetime investment , and figure that since track is the most important item on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheap with it . <p> Same applies to transformers , although for maximum power most choose from either the MTH Z-4000 or the Lionel ZW-L if they are interested in the latest and most feature-laden power sources . <p> Everyone has his or her own preferences , as you 'll soon learn when others respond to this thread . <p> It all depends on what you want out of a track system . Fast track may be a bit expensive but it is a very good track . The switches are highly rated . The biggest down side would be the track noise . What you have to watch out for is the slide shoes . Some of the scale track requires tweaks if the slide shoes need to run over switches or the slide shoes may snag and rip off . Tubular is probably the cheapest route to go for track choices . But you wo n't get the variety in switch configurations . If you are building a temp layout or carpet central then a track with built in roadbed would be a good choice . If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Avoid track that is not magnetic . Stay with Lionel , Ross , Gargraves etc . I believe all MTH track is nickel-silver which is non magnetic . <p> As for transformers , since you want to run modern as well as older stuff , I would recommend a new transformer . They work best with the newer electronics . A Z4000 or a Zw with the bricks would be a good choice . The current top of the line is the ZW-L . <p> If you can provide some info about your layout that would help with the recommendations - Size , numer of trains running at one time , permanent or temp layout . <p> It seems like these same questions about track and transformer come up about 100 times a year . I can understand wanting to know information about the subjects from new members or those just getting into the hobby but just remember you are only getting individual opinions on what members like best . <p> The statement above is true , there is no best , it is up to you what you like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own , looking at track and transformer options at train or hobby stores ; try to see operating layouts with different track and place the options in your hand before you make any purchases . The most important thing is take your time , these will be some of the most important purchases for your O gauge train hobby . <p> some of the ones with chopped sine waves do not work and play well with older boards and are not universal . Especially PS1 locos which some of us run . Read the review of the new ZW in OGR in the past issues . Some of the board components got hot with the new ZW , not to pick on that but it is an example . Stick with a pure sine wave and you can run anything . <p> Dale H <p> True . <p> I had mixed results across a few Proto-1 engines . I am pretty sure I initially successfully used a ZW-L to power my MTH Proto-1 WVP&amp;P Shay ( did not know about the board temp thing , but I may be more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to power an older MTH Proto-1 NYC Empire State Express engine , it would not move . <p> I almost thought the engine had died , but I then proved it was OK with an old PW ZW . Point is , I do n't think we can even paint Proto-1 with a broad brush in terms of saying one will or wo n't work with a given transformer . <p> As others have said , if you are all Lionel , you will not have any Proto-1 oddities to consider . <p> Swank , Allan is correct , there is no absolute best , however if you are running Tin plate Trainsthere are is some track to avoid . However if you are running all modern trains you can pick from lots of different track and swithces . In the transformer area , always pick a large enough power supply to keep expanding your layout , I would start with no less than one ZW transformer , if you can afford a Z4K all the better.I chose FasTrack for my bigger layouts and have a combination of FasTrack and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run well on both.PCRR/Dave <p> Some of the larger office/game room FasTrack layout . 175857 @qwx375857 <p> As you can already see you will get lots of advice for this or that . Whatever you decide , keep in mind that often the most expensive track you can get is the track that had costs the least up front . Fastrack , Atlas , etc. , do cost more - but a lot more people swear by them than at them . <p> Unfortunately , it will not fit your needs due to its low-profile rail design . The problem is that prewar Lionel wheels have very large-diameter flanges that tend to interfere with the ties and switch frogs . I am not sure , but it is possible that this may also be an issue with other " realistic " track designs . I tend to agree with Jim that given your constraints , O-72 tubular would be hard to beat . <p> Objectively , the best track is one that best fits your proposed layout . Unsure ? A LHS is a great place to start , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and see what you like . <p> As for the transformer , select it based upon your load requirement . Buying the newest , biggest , baddest transformer is probably a poor choice if you only have a 4x8 layout . Make sure the transformer has a fast , modern circuit breaker . The old stuff wo n't care , but it 's life and death for the newer locomotives . <p> Two questions that I can not answer because I do not have first hand experience with all the track or transformers made . <p> To me the most pain in the back side is the old Lionel track but it sure has its fans . I love my Lionel Fast Track and I am ok with my MTH Real Track . I never used any other types . <p> Transformer - well I do n't use one for my layout . I just use the Lionel 180 bricks in combination with my MTH TIU and Lionel TMCC . Thus I can not give an opinion for the best layout transformer . <p> For the three loops around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them better than the Lionel CW -80 . My guess on the better transformer would me the MTH Z-4000 but only because it is big bucks cheaper than the newer Lionel ZW . <p> I can get my hands on some ( super 0 track who makes it ) , its not so wimsey lookin <p> Its got a real small middle rail , will all my locos run on that <p> Super O was a Lionel product . Will all your locos run on it ? I du n no ; it depends upon the minimum curve diameter requirement for your loco . It still has a broad following . If you have adequate supply to construct your layout , go for it . <p> There is plenty of Super-O around . More expensive than postwar tubular , but cheaper than anything new . As I said , it wo n't work for prewar . The other negative is that it was only ever produced in 36 " diameter curves . However , it is quite possible to rework Super-O curves into arbitrary radii . The information on how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a challenge , but many people mix other brand switches with Super-O track . With its flat copper center rail , Super-O is about as good-looking as 3-rail is ever going to get . <p> If you are intrigued , I suggest you subscribe to the Super-O Yahoo ! group : <p> Swank - when it comes to track , one thing that should - but rarely ever is - discussed is electrical connectivity . Full disclosure - I went with Atlas because of aethetics and because nickel silver is a good electrical conductor . Having said that , the rail material itself is only part of the equation . What really matters is how the track sections fit together from an electrical flow standpoint . I believe Atlas is probably the riskiest of all the track choices . This is based on the fact that the sections do n't  actually interlock in any way . They rely on those little track connectors to stay tight . I 'm in the process of laying track now and happy to report that I have zero issues - when I ensure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relax over time ? I just do n't know . Looking at Ross , GarGraves , Tubular Lionel and even MTH scale trax - from a structural standpoint , it seems they all should have superior electrical conductivity . The hollow track choices have a steel pin that deeply inserts into it 's neighboring track section . Solid connection . And , the MTH scale stuff has two metal pressure clip things that mash against each other creating what should be a very good connection too . In terms of turnouts and transformers , that it much more a matter of opinion . Peter <p> I can get my hands on some ( super 0 track who makes it ) , its not so wimsey lookin <p> Its got a real small middle rail , will all my locos run on that <p> My understanding ( and I have not tried it ... ) is that any engine with pickup shoes instead of pickup rollers will have a hard time with Super O. I am going to guess that some Marx engines and some prewar Lionel engines that have single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the gear goes all the way to the edge of the flange ) will not make it through a switch or crossing . However that 's a problem for nearly every track system . Most people who have engines like that will include a loop of track on the layout with no switches ( or crossings ) for those units . <p> Before I spent a lot of money on Super O , I would recommend joining the Yahoo group mentioned earlier in this thread . There 's a ton of info there and a good bunch of guys to help you out . <p> As for transformers , stick with anything that puts out a pure sine wave and you 'll be able to run nearly anything . If you are running really old prewar , you may need a prewar transformer to get the voltages needed to make the trains fly off the track , but I think that was just a standard gauge thing . Some of the prewar transformers put out up to 24 volts , whereas postwar and newer ones top out at around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modern engines , you may need to add a sound activation button or two to blow the horn or ring the bell . <p> It 's good to mention about having good electrical connections in the track . <p> The one thing that I look for is how well does it fit together if you do a custom track plan ? Well I can say that Fastrack fails greatly in this department as it needs small fitter pieces to do what I use to do with tubular track in 042 and Fastrack do n't always stay together for me . I had it on a floor layout , not fastened down . <p> A little FYI , I am still using a postwar ZW transformer that I bought in the 1960 's , replaced the rollers once or twice and cleaned the contact area . <p> Lee Fritz 175859 @qwx375859 <p> May I suggest something to the OP ? You mention you are running trains from all eras , and that you found fasttrack to be too expensive , but it would be a lot easier if you were a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a layout , or is this carpet central ? And how big is the layout going to be ? With a 4x8 , the difference in price is n't going to be prohibitive , but if you are dreaming of a 20x25 layout the difference in track prices may be ...... <p> 2 ) If you are building a floor layout , tubular or something like RealTrax or Fasttrack may be the way to go , because of the way they mate together ( Gargraves could work ) . They IMO will work better for temporary layouts . <p> 3 ) Are you looking to make a more realistic look , or is it more a toy train/tinplate look ? If you want the tracks to look more realistic , then Gargraves or Atlas or MTH Scale Trax would be good choices . <p> Gargraves to me is one of the better bargains , you can get it on a foot by foot basis cheaper than most other track types , other than standard lionel tubular track . Gargraves in its flex track form is easier to work with , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is relatively modestly priced because it is 37 " long pieces , that I saw a 51 box of used for like 170 ( on the other hand , there was some moron selling a 51 box new at 370 , when you can get it for 100 bucks cheaper at any number of dealers ) .... most track can be found used , it simply is a matter of looking for it on the bay , at shows and such , and finding the good price . <p> Again , a lot depends on your requirements , the question about best track is very individual . As I plan my first real layout in a long time , I am planning on using Gargraves and Ross , it seems to have the combination of price and looks and performance that will work for me . <p> Now on to the transformer : <p> 1 ) Are you planning to run multiple trains ? If so , a larger transformer like a ZW , Z4000 makes sense . You can get rebuilt post war ZW'a or used z4000 's for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modern engines , I would recommend thinking about a Z4000 or newer ZW ( which could , as others point out , have issues with some older modern engines , like PS1 systems I believe ) . <p> Plus , are you planning to have a lot of track switches with switch motors ? Are you planning accessories and lighting ? If so , you may want to have multiple transformers , to run the trains and then everything else . <p> Then , too , if you have modern command control engines , you may want to think about command control , using one of the transformers mentioned ( I would suggest using a modern transformer , though older ones can work with fast blow circuit breakers and surge protection ) . <p> Again , it comes down to yourself and what your needs are . I recommend actually looking for pictures of the various track systems , and see what you like and also keep in mind that running older rolling stock from the deep flange era , some track systems ( like Scale Trax or Atlas ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( gargraves , fastrack ) might not have . <p> Unless you have actually built a layout with each type of track and each type of switch and operated it for a few years you ca n't really say which is best . Even then it is what is best for you and what your doing with it . 175854 @qwx375854 175853 @qwx375853 <h> Block 175862 @qwx375862

@@36015039 @5015039/ <h> Which is the Lionel ZW to get ? <p> I am interested in purchasing my first ZW . Is there a particular variation that is more robust , higher power , etc ? Also , where is a good place for parts , repairs and tune-ups ? I would like to acquire a unit and keep it in running order for a very long time . <p> Well , the newer versions can support up to 4 180-watt bricks for a total of 720 watts , and the ZW-L is 620 watts in one unit . Those are your high- power options , though they 're obviously more expensive and there have been some reliability issues with the " new " ZW 's . For reliability , simplicity and ease of repair , a postwar 275-watt ZW is the way to go . The rated wattage on this unit is input wattage ; you 'll get about 180-200 watts output . Postwar ZW 's are less expensive as well , rebuilt ones can be had for under $200 . <p> Postwar 275 watt ZW . As Mike Lavender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In general , total usable output wattage was historically considered to be about 75% of the printed rating , in this case 275 watts x .75 = 206 watts . That 's the total output ; there are 4 control handles on a postwar ZW , so divide the 206 watts by 4 to obtain the usable output wattage from each control handle if you 're using all of them ( it 's helpful to know the wattage draw of accessories , too ) . If the transformer is outputting near or at its maximum , it will definitely get quite warm after 30 minutes of use . Many years ago I mitigated this condition by replacing the carbon rollers with gold rollers ( which were made by a dentist in Wisconsin ) . Gold has extremely low electrical resistance so less heat builds up from the flow of electricity from the copper transformer coil windings through the carbon roller to the roller pin and thence to the copper control arm . Gold is also harder than carbon rollers and will outlast them by pretty close to a human lifetime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has gone up so much that replacing the carbon rollers certainly is n't cost effective any longer . A correction for Mike Lavender ( above post ) , it 's not input wattage ; the ZW will only draw what 's needed for output . If you have a single motored postwar engine ( like a 726 Berkshire ) , it 'll draw about 30-35 watts ( 2 motored engines draw about 60 watts ) , then 2-bulb passenger cars with incandescent lamps , say 4 cars , at 4 watts per bulb = 32 watts . 35 + 32 = 67 watts . Add in some rolling resistance , and the draw from the ZW will likely be around 75-80 watts . Then add on a couple of accessories or another train using another control handle , or both , and the usable output of the transformer will approach maximum . Phil <p> My post war ZW with 275 watts has been working since the 1960 's with only some occasion cleaning of the roller area and one roller going bad . I never had a problem with power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and have not noticed it getting very warm . <p> The new ZW 's since 1995 have some design flaws to say the least ! Handles may fall off , or cross-over voltage from one terminal to another , this occurs with the add-on power brick addition of the ZW . Classic Toy Trains had many a post in the past about faulty ZW 's from the current production . <p> The ZW-L is rather new and has not been reported on , so I would wait to see the reports before buying a new ZW . <p> If you want just power go with the post war Z transformer , has 250 watts input and four train control , just no whistle or direction buttons . <p> Lee F. 175859 @qwx375859 <p> What size is the layout , how many trains do you plan on running at one time , are you running lighted passenger cars , and what kind of engines ? These are all major considerations if you 're looking for max power . <p> Does n't matter if it says 250 or 275 watt 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the safest way to go . However there are thousands of them out there all still working today . First safety tip is check the AC cord for damage . <p> Sounds good . I am considering it for running 2-3 trains max , plus some accessories on a small-medium sized layout . I am also in the process on converting all of my lighting to LED to reduce current draw . <p> Daniel , go to the lionel customer service youtube channel and look for a segment called choped verses smooth sign wave transformers.Mike gives a great explanation of postwar zw 's and newer zw 's and how they affect todays modern trains . This maybe helpful in letting you know how a postwar zw and a newer zw can effect how the newer command engines perform . I am going to get a new ZW-L after they have been on the market for a while and all the first batch bugs have been ironed out . A good transformer is the key to any size layout . Big ones such as a zw are a lot of money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right.As everyone has stated the postwar zw is good . But watch the video from mike regan then make your choice . if you only run postwar trains the postwar zw is ok . But if you run legacy or tmcc engines you might think about waiting on the new Zw-l to ship . Then again thier are the 180 watt bricks and a tpc . The video will explain a lot trust me on this . <p> I bought my first postwar ZW at York this year and I love it . The classic look , the feel and the solid construction are hard to resist . A rebuilt unit by an experienced professional is the way to go . I usually avoid plugging in any type of electrical device with original 1950 's insulation . 175852 @qwx375852 <p> I do n't buy all the hype about the chopped vs. pure sine wave . My legacy stuff runs like a top on the PowerHouse 180 bricks , and they 're a plain transformer with a pure sine wave . The only difference I see is you got a bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get all the smoke I can handle from the Legacy and MTH stuff , no extra boost needed . <p> If you have ( or plan on having ) a Legacy or TMCC set-up the ZW with the 180w bricks is nice . I have been using mine in command mode running conventional equipment . Lionel customer service ( LIONELCS2011 ) has a 35 minute Youtube video that shows what the ZW-C can actually do . Search " ZW-C " <p> Daniel , You 've gotten plenty of very good advice so far , so if this is helpful additionally , here 's is a view of my set-up that has been powering the whole layout - 4 old ZW 's and one newer type - since 1995 . None of them have ever been serviced or repaired . I just found them randomly at shows and at my LHS . Plus , I bought an extra ZW I keep stored under the layout , just in case . <p> The five of them run ten trains , only two trains per ZW , using just the larger handles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separate loop for a trolley , using a smaller arm ; another one powers a Rotary Beacon on a smaller handle , too . <p> One thing I did discover , though , even with spreading my trains out among the five ZW 's , which is that whenever I have tried to run two passenger trains ( scale cars and scale steamers ) in-tandem on the same track , the power would sputter and very quickly blink out . I soon learned that all those lights were too much for one handle . <p> If it 's further helpful for you to know , I 've run trains by Lionel ( my preferred manf. due to the convenience of TMCC and cruise-control ) , Weaver ; MTH ; Williams ; K-Line ; Atlas ; 3rdRail with those five ZW 's . However , nowadays , I run strictly the TMCC Lionel engines , esp . since visits to our layout by guests this Holiday season will be aplenty . The TMCC is best for my needs , as is the obvious ZW commitment I have made , all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can get with the house full of guests . <p> Frank M. <p> Imagination is more important than knowledge.Knowledge has limits . Dr. W.Dyer 175852 @qwx375852 <p> Daniel , I did n't see if you mentioned what trains your planning on operating . Older Postwar engines ? If so , Postwar ZW is the way to go , especially with the big drop in prices lately , I recently saw several boxed ones at a TCA meet in the $175 range . <p> If your planning on operating any modern engines with newer electronics , you might want to consider the MTH 4000 , you 'll need it 's super fast acting circuit breakers to protect the electronics in the modern engines . The older Postwar ZW 's lack the appropriate protection for the electronics of today . <p> You can install fast acting automotive fuses in the transformer output lines A , B , C , D ; not on the U or common side . Scott 's Odds ' n ' Ends sells a fast acting , resettable 4-circuit breaker ; available in a couple or three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 10 amp between the ZW and the track . Phil <p> I 'll second Bluegill 's comment about the price drop on ZW 's . Definitely the most affordable " bigger power " out there , and with fast-acting breakers or fuses as mtnhi7 suggested , safe for newer engines . <p> As an alternative choice , the proven UL rated MTH Z-4000 is a very reliable and powerful transformer with nano-second circuit breakers , micro-processor control circuitry , fan cooling , and easy to read digital volt and amp meters . <p> That 's a good choice if he sticks with only 2 trains , but if he adds the third train and wants independent control he 'd need a second Z-4000 or some other transformer to pick up the third . ( Since TMCC/Legacy or DCS has not been mentioned , I 'm assuming Daniel wants conventional handle control edit : I see now Daniel has posted that he is looking for PW operation , so this holds true ) . <p> As mentioned in previous posts , the 3rd and 4th handles on the ZW do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to control a train , and if you really need it , you can add whistle/bell buttons to get that for handles B and C. <p> Another thought , while it 's possibly overkill for just running conventional , if you were to run a modern ZW with a TMCC ( or Legacy ) base and remote ( just to gain control of the output voltage remotely , which works for conventional locomotives ) , you then can get the whistle/horn from those B &amp; C outputs as well ( but this is only an attractive option if you like the remote idea , a TMCC base/remote set would cost you more ( much more for Legacy ) than some 5906 sound activation buttons ) . <p> I do n't mean to hi-jack the thread , but it seems many people who have posted here would know this answer . Why has n't anyone recommended the postwar KW ? Using Mtnhi7 's example , with a ZW there are 206 watts to be used by four handles . With the KW , is n't it 142 watts for two handles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the KW ? I 'm guessing not , since nobody suggested it here , but I do n't get why . If nothing else , if a single KW can be had for less than half the cost of a ZW , would n't two KW 's be better for the original posters question ? <p> I just picked up a ZW yesterday to power my MPC era passanger trains on the Christmas layout . I have n't gotten a chance to try it out yet but I 'm expecting to have to make the usual upgrades I 've made in the past when buying a used postwar transformer ( KW &amp; 1099 ) I 've gotten kind of used to downloading the service manuas from Olsen 's Toy Train parts , but their website has become more inconsistant then usual . I hate to bother Jeff Kane at Train Tender for something I may not need . So if anyone one has or knows where to find a pdf file for the service manual for a ZW-174 , 275watt transformer it sure would be apreciated. 175852 @qwx375852 <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had for a lot less than one ZW . Two KW , s give you whistle and direction control on all 4 outputs . If ( big if ) one goes bad you can still run some trains . And that is what it is all about . <p> The KW is fine , but the ZW is the gold standard . I never could get used to the opposing handles on the KW ( one goes " up " to increase voltage , the other goes " down " ) . I use KWs for accesory power and run my trains with ZWs . You really can not beat the ZW for reliability , utility and ease of use . <p> Daniel , you had asked about parts . Try Harry Lutz . Phone 610-442-9620 . Harryflutz@aol.com . Harry sells refurbished transformes , parts and also fixes them . They come with a warranty also . I have bought many from him . Always worked great and very fair pricing . <p> On the pw 275 ZWtype R all four throttles are connected to the same core--the transformer 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the ZW is available to any one throttle or , spread out over all throttles-----two or four depending what you are using to operate . <p> The railpower load on Throttle " A 's " power district " will determine its wattage demand and likwise for the load on throttle " D 's " district . However they are drinking from the same bucket not separate ones . I expect the KW is the same--a single core . <p> Dewey , you are correct , the KW has a single core and the two wipers are in parallel across it . <p> I bought an MRC PurePower 270 for $125 recently , it 's a really nice transformer . Very " ZW-Like " in the configuration of the two handles , just does n't have the other two variable outputs , just one fixed 14V output for accessories . It does have a modern whistle/bell capability , and actually outputs a true 270 watts . Of course , the dual sets of meters are useful as well . These transformers actually have 7A breakers on each handle , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either side , that really is n't an issue for me . They are a real sine wave transformer , having a large toroid transformer with some really robust carbon wipers for pickups . <p> If you get a good deal on one of these , they 're a worthwhile alternative to the ZW for most users . <p> Daniel - I have 2 post war ZW I 'd like to sell if you 're interested - I 've been using them on my layout for the past 22 years . They are still hooked up to the layout but I 'm now looking for Z4000 's . If you 're interested let me know . <p> " I knew I was going to take the wrong train , so I left early !

As many of you probably know , Darstaed has been planning an engine shed for some time , and that shed will be available soon from Trains Hoover and Weaver as well . The Darstaed shed is lovingly modeled after the original Hornby shed , I personally reproduced that artwork here in the USA . I tried carefully to match the colors and details , so the Darstaed shed will look at home alongside a Hornby shed . I also created two other designs , the American shed and the Fieldstone shed . <p> The American was also Hornby-inspired , Hornby fans may notice the roof is similar to the one on the Hornby Wayside Station ( circa 1928 ) . It is brightly colored in the style of early Hornby tinplate , with a classic keystone above every arch and a " red white and blue " color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was designed . <p> For those who prefer something less loud , I created a Fieldstone version that will look at home in a big city or small town styled layout . I am considering one final version that has a brick pattern similar to ( but not identical to ) the Lionel Backshop , which inspired it . <p> As you can see by the photos of the Darstaed shed in production , the arrival will be soon for that version , followed by other versions in the fall . As the sheds are a bit of an investment , we know that most people will be buying only one . We want to know what your favorite design concepts are , so we are asking here . <p> All sheds are expandable from 13.5 inched to 27 inches . A Darstaed Pannier or Lionel Jeep should fit comfortably in a standard shed , and a long engine like a Duchess of Southerland will find the expanded sheds a nice home . At this time only the Darstaed sheds will be available in single engine models , but if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ model artwork we can use . Prices will start at $245 USD for the single engine Darstaed model , $325 for the expanded model , and of course if you get a standard model , extensions will be available separately . All double sheds will be priced at $295 for a standard and $395 for an extended . For more information and bigger images , see the Trains Hover website . <p> unfortunately Trains Hoover has ended its relationship with Darstead and other makers of British prototype trains etc .

@@36015044 @5015044/ <h> FasTrack Switches Remote/Command Differences and DCS <p> Before Christmas I constructed a temporary FasTrack Christmas layout with two simple ovals , one O36 and the other O48 . Now I want to expand that layout a bit , and be able to connect the two loops with switches . I am using the plan from OGR Run 275 by Ken Hoganson . Because of impending surgeries on each of my hands this winter , I thought this would be something I could build over the winter and have some fun with it . I am not up to the task of finishing my ceiling level layout this winter . <p> So , I need some O60 FasTrack switches . I am asking for input on which type to purchase . Lionel lists three types , Remote , Command Control , and Remote/Command Control . I have looked at the manuals on their Web site , but do not understand the benefits of each type . It seems like each can be used in manual or command mode . I am happy to operate the ones on the front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ones on the back remotely/command . Also , I have a DCS and not a TMCC or Legacy . I take it I should have no problem using a AIU to connect to the FasTrack switches . However , I do not have one at this time , so that cost would be factored in . <p> I would like to spend as little as possible , but still have the features mentioned above . I ca n't tell if it is worth the extra cost to get the Remote/Command or even the Command variety . I come from a background of many years in HO shelf layouts , where I always used manual switches , so all of this is new to me . <p> Let me give you an engineering over view of what you are planning to attempt . <p> 1st off all the new FasTrack switches coming out now , will all be Command Control , because Lionel understands the CC FT switches can also be controlled via the manual remote controllers . The great thing about the CC FT switches is that they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with more than 20 switches in operation , and even a great number more if the DCS blocks are layouted out correctly . So if you already have Legacy or TMCC all your CC FT switches are controlled from the Cab2 or TMCC Cab1 remote controls , via the Aux buttons . I would not go the AIU purchase route , because I believe in eliminating as much wiring as possible , on the newer type layouts . In fact the older TMCC stuff is probably going to cost you about the same , as a couple of AIU 's if you have a lot of switches . In fact I am waiting for the new Lionel 031 FT CC switches to come out , to transition FT CC switches in and out of my MTH RealTrax inner oval , so I have remote control FT CC switches on all my different levels , controlled from my Cab2 remote control . If I were you I would sell my FT regular remote control switches , to off set the purchase of the new FT CC switches , and invest in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a hand held remote control , along with setting up your manual controllers . <p> Mark good luck with your surgeries and have a good time constructing your new FT layout . <p> PCRR/Dave <p> I like to set the manual switch controllers right along the tracks to identify the switch numbers I have programmed into the Cab2 remote control , this really helps when you have a lot of switches in operation on your layout , instant switch number identification from the lighted controller numbers . 175857 @qwx375857 175852 @qwx375852 <p> thank you for your insight . I like your method shown in your photo putting your controllers near the switch and not on one control panel . I will only be buying a couple at a time , so it wo n't be too bad . That is one thing that I have not looked at in the DCS of keeping track of a lot of switches . I guess they could be named descriptively besides being numbered . <p> Thank you for the advice and for the well wishes on my surgeries . The first will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ switches can be programed for use with Legacy Remotes . If you do not have TMCC or Legacy , go with the FT non CC remote switches . They can be wired into a AIU if you add one latter . If you do n't want the switch controller , you can throw them by hand by turning the lantern . <p> On the other hand , the CC switches are about 10 bucks more , and may fetch a better resale price to Legacy users if you decide to get rid of them . I use LCS and Legacy so I will only be buying CC switches in the future . <p> Unless anyone purchases an older or used FT Switch everyone will be purchasing CC FT switches , cause its all Lionel is going to make in FT Switches . So if any of these guys &amp; gals want a manual remote FT switch from a dealer , they better get it right quick . Frankly I can not see even purchasing one now that the CC switches are available , although if you want to you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ switches into CC type switches , Ron did this to one of his layouts prior to CC FT switches even coming out . <p> PCRR/Dave 175857 @qwx375857 <p> many thanks ! As I look at some of our supplier 's Web sites , I am seeing som only listing CC switches . <p> Miken , I can see your point about the non CC switches . <p> I see Legacy Station is offering O60 command control ones for $89 each . That may be a good way to go . I have had good success with them in the past . My two ( sort of local hobby shops ) do n't have them on O60 at this time . <p> FWIW , I believe the CC FT switches are selling for about the same as the Remote FT switches were . Without Legacy , the command control can certainly be done with the addition of an AIU since you are already invested in DCS . An AIU is much cheaper than a Legacy system , but a single AIU wll only manage 10 switches . I have both Legacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ systems and about 20 FT remote switches for a great price in an aestate sale . The AIU works like a charm . <p> Well , I decided to purchase two of the O60 CC switches and some other track from Legacy Depot at the price I mentioned above . That will get me going , and I will see how they work out . I will need 4 more switches to complete the plan . Spread the cost out a bit , and I 'm not in a position to build very fast anyway . 175854 @qwx375854 175853 @qwx375853 <h> Block 175862 @qwx375862

This prompted me to buy five more pairs for the other cars and remove the Kadees I had installed . I 'm planning to buy more to convert some Atlas 53-foot Evans cars over . <p> Unfortunately , I do n't have a photo of them in a train yet ( maybe tomorrow ) but the big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the cars are actually farther apart than with the three-rail couplers installed . 175856 @qwx375856 <p> " Why is it necessary to remove the Weaver scale couplers at all ? Will they not couple with the Kadees on other cars ? " <p> The older Weaver 2 rail couplers were not very well designed , the trip pins spin around and end up facing backwards most of the time and they lack the positive knuckle springs that Kadees use .. Kadees take a different box than the Weaver couplers so they likely wo n't drop in to the Weaver extended draft gear . I ca n't recall if it 's possible to modify the Weaver box for Kadees . This might be why I built my own extenders from brass flat bar stock . I have n't worked with the latest Weaver cars so they might have improved the couplers recently ? ...... DaveB <p> Kinda Bob , but the car really does n't move . The cushion drawbar slides back and forth under the car on the ends .

When the crew came to a hook on that car , the drawbar compressed and there went his foot . He did n't lose it completely , but never did come back to work . <p> Maybe Matt will stop back and address if the newer Weaver scale couplers will work with Kadees ? The pic of the draft boxes looks good . I have seven of these cars to do and am reluctant to place an order with Weaver if their coupler is not suitable . <p> Maybe Matt will stop back and address if the newer Weaver scale couplers will work with Kadees ?

I 've been busy prepping for the York/Houston trip and just got back . The plan is to get a few more pairs and disassemble the housing to see how a Kadee fits . My recollection is that the Weaver shank and the Kadee shank are very similar and I think the Kadee will fit in a Weaver box , but I have to run some tests . <p> One of the guys on the 2-rail forum 3-D printed some shock control boxes for Kadees . The thread might still be up so you can do a search . His were pretty detailed , but I do n't know how strong they are . 175856 @qwx375856 <p> Had stack of work waiting for me when I got back . I did take a photo of the coupled distance between the Weaver 57-foot Mechanical Reefers using the scale " shock control " couplers . It 's actually farther apart than the 3-rail couplers . Go figure . The box design is pretty simple and I 'm sure could be enhanced with a little bit of styrene glued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple of them apart to see if I can put Kadee 740 's in their place . 175856 @qwx375856 175854 @qwx375854 175853 @qwx375853 <h> Block 175862 @qwx375862 
@@36015046 @5015046/ <h> Resistors and Converters for LED Bulbs <p> In the TMCC section of the forum , I 'm upgrading my Lionel Southern Mikado circa 1992 to full ERR Cruise and updated RailSounds . <p> While doing that , I wanted to replace the LED 's to make the connections simpler .

I have not seen them in white though . You should be able to put a 3mm white LED in the headlight . <p> Since I wanted to keep the class lamps illuminated constantly like the headlight ( as per real life operations ) , I decided that I needed an AC/DC converter to hook up to them ( the 2mm ones that Pete mentioned for 1.7-2.2 V ) . <p> However , I ca n't quite find one for this .

You do n't need an AC/DC converter , unless you consider a 5 cent diode and AC/DC converter . <p> ... but I ca n't seem to find grain of rice bulbs on their site that can fit into the classification lights . I do n't think the 1.8 mm bulbs will fit because the opening in the lamps is so skinny . <p> Consider acrylic ( plastic ) optical fiber available in several diameters smaller than 1.8mm . Then you can use a 3mm , 2mm , whatever size LED in the engine and run the fiber to the class lights . The following illustrates the concept applied to different colors . You can run 2 ( or more ) fibers back to a single-LED. 175852 @qwx375852 <p> For markers , I 'd consider a 1N4003 ( my standard diode for most uses ) , and a 1K 1/4W resistor . If they 're too bright , just go up to a 2.2K 1/4W resistor . With two markers , if you wire them in opposite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they protect themselves from reverse voltage , see illustration below . <p> For LED headlights , I use a 470 ohm 1/4W resistor and the same diode . If I have two headlights , I wire them as above if using track power and dispense with the diode . <p> Remember , if you 're wiring from the TMCC headlight outputs , those are half-wave DC with positive ground for command operation , but full-wave AC for conventional operation . That affects how you wire them over just using track power . You will need the diode as you ca n't wire multiple LED 's as above , they must all have their positive leads going to frame ground . <p> I normally run markers/class lights at much lower currents ( and brightness ) than headlights . I think the locomotive looks kinda ' silly when the class lights are brighter than the headlight ! <p> A basic rule of thumb with a single 20ma LED is take the value of the DC voltage applied , subtract the operating voltage for the LED ( 3V for white/blue , and 2V @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by 50 . That 's the minimum resistance you should ever use for the LED . For rectified track power , I consider the voltage to be 9V DC . For a white LED headlight , that would be 6V to drop across the resistor or 300 ohms . I do n't like to run that close to the maximums , so my value of 470 is my standard . For the class lights or markers , I usually go larger with the resistor to achieve the desired brightness . 175852 @qwx375852 <p> The 2mm ceramic lights should fit . The fiber may be problematic as you have to make a 90 degree bend out of the boiler front into the class light fixture , fiber wo n't bend that sharp . Also , most of the light from the fiber is out the end , that would be point in one direction if you could get it stuffed into the class light . 175852 @qwx375852 <p> That 's a good point . To solve the right-angle " bend " problem or for multi-directional lens fixtures like on a caboose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that the light scatters sideways ( rather than only going straight out the end ) . This is illustrated below for the forward and rear facing door/brake lights on an Amtrak passenger car . Photos pasted together from another thread . Modern LEDs are so bright/efficient that there is plenty of light to go around so-to-speak ! <p> Since I 'll be buying the Super Chuffer as well , and I 'll be buying the headlight , back up light and firebox light from here : http : **40;618;TOOLONG to hook up to it , I just need what to hook up for the class lamps to track power , not to the TMCC board , so they 'll stay lit no matter what direction the engine is going .

Boom ! You are done ! <p> I 'm still going to hook up the class lamps the first method with the 1K 1/4W or 2.2K 1/4W resistor , since it seems alright for both conventional and command environments .

@@36015047 @5015047/ 175852 @qwx375852 <p> I 've used both the Free version of Any Rails , and SCARM . AR is more intuitive , but SCARM is the right price . <p> For easier gradients what you can do is highlight the run of track that makes up the gradient , toggle on " Track Heights " , and then select the little red square at the top ( highest ) end of your highlighted section . You can then use the " &lt; " and " &gt; " keys to quickly set the terminal height of your gradient . The rest of the highlighted section should set automatically to create a smooth ramp . <p> To elevate and entire section , follow the same instructions , but hit the " Enter " key after you have set your height . Then all highlighted sections will be set to the terminal height . <p> What I do n't like with SCARM is you have to get loops to line up perfectly or they wo n't complete . Fasttrack normally has a little give to it , so there are often times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it wo n't ... <p> Someone just told me about it , I played with it a little bit yesterday and found it to be a little clunky at first , but got better once I figured it out . My big beef with it is that it does n't  have a ross/gargraves library . That would be a huge help , especially the ross switch inventory . Also , it does n't  seem to like things where a custom cut or fitter track might be necessary . It works for basic things though . <p> My thought on the track planners has always been one which gives you a general idea and a starting material list . I always end up tweaking things when I start building . <p> I 've been using it quite a bit the previous two weeks . Since I have some fastrack , it is useful for that track library . But when I want to " dream " about gargraves or RCS track , it has no library for those . I love the 3D views , but there is no benchwork component @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the developer is still working on it . He just released a new version a few weeks ago . <p> And Ace , note I have not used any non-free software , but I find it easy to make an even gradient along a given stretch of track even if there are curves . Select a range of track , enable the elevation tool and set the elevation on one end of the range . It adjusts the elevation at each track connection along the range . However in my experience , you can not include a switch in that range . <p> Thanks guys , now I see how to easily make a uniform grade along a stretch of track . I do n't know why I could n't make it work before . <p> One thing SCARM does n't do in the usual manner for Windows : holding &lt;shift&gt; while selecting two pieces of track does not include all the pieces in between . Pieces all have to be selected while holding &lt;ctrl&gt; ? 175852 @qwx375852 <p> Yes , I 've noticed that too . But you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be selected as well . I will often remove a single piece of track so I can double-click a large section of track without including the unwanted pieces . You can also draw a box around a selection set . <p> I have been using SCARM quite a bit to get started . I have only used it for Fastrack . It does n't always line up , but the track does " give " on the layout . <p> You can select multiple pieces of track by holding the left mouse button and dragging across the pieces you wan so long as they are continuous . Also , any pieces that are the same color can be selected at once by double clicking any one of them . <p> I 'm liking SCARM more as I figure out the various features . I 've just recently learned how to add trees and structures , and how to contour scenery . <p> This layout example is 4'x 9 ' , O27 curves with O54 easements , 4.3% grade on the front side and 6.3% grade on the back side . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ block between the ascending and descending grades . The idea is to represent a winding grade that crosses a ridge in a compact layout , and to demonstrate the 3-D capability of SCARM . <p> I like the SCARM software for layout track . I 'm just have n't been able to figure out the sceanery part ; How to get the landscape to elevate with the track and add trees and rivers . <p> I guess I do n't really need it that much since I 'm only building a display of loops at different elevations . But it would be cool to see how the Forests , waterfalls and rivers I want to add would look . <p> I have been using SCARM since December . As with all software , you run into something that you do n't like . I traded several emails with the author and those changes were included in revision 9.18 . <p> I believe it is very powerful and easy to use , once one understands how to get there . <p> Considering that it is free and I use only FasTrack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into it trying to design the spiral mountain for a Polar Express layout . <p> I find it a little annoying creating specific angles for the baseboard , as Milen calls it , using absolute coordinates from the toolbox and trig translated to the baseboard coordinates . RRtrack wo n't do what SCARM can for baseboards . The gradient features are really good . When tracks have a double diamond on straight , I can cut a custom piece . I try to fit the curves perfectly . <p> The ballast in 3-D really makes one check actual spacing . A small niggle in the 3-D rendering . Here 's my spiral mountain ( not a helix , a spiral ) It 's 60 " wide and climbs to 19.25 " from 0 " in 591.5 " of track . A 3.3 percent gradient . Note how the ballast is so close to the lower level the terrain overlaps in the 3-D rendering . It does clear . 175852 @qwx375852 <p> I like the SCARM software for layout track .

The example above is not practical to separate according to the colors because of too many tracks crossing so many table joints . <p> The rule of thumb with modules is to minimize the total number of places where tracks have to be joined across modules , and keep the connections on straight tracks as much as possible . There have been lots of discussions about making track connections between modules . <p> I have used the same " core module " on my HO layout for the last 30+ years . It 's a 3-lap multi-level oval with sidings in 54 " x 72 " . This " core module " has a wye on one corner which connects to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my point is that if you can design some module sections that can adapt to different spaces , maybe with connecting sections being varied to suit , it makes a way to expedite moving and reconstructing a layout when necessary . <p> Another approach is to just make the benchwork modular and build a " tinplate " style layout with all the track , buildings , scenery etc removable . That gives more freedom to change your track plan around if you want . It all depends on what kind of layout you want . <p> Those are just some thoughts off the top of my head . Now I see that you have another post going where you are making good progress towards planning a new layout . 175854 @qwx375854 175853 @qwx375853 <h> Block 175862 @qwx375862

@@36015051 @5015051/ <h> Running two trains with one transformer <p> I am in the process of starting my layout . I know that it is going to be 6 feet by 12 feet rectangle . I have two trains I want to use . The older train ( Lionel Allegheny Set ) has a 90 watt transformer that still works great . I purchased the Lionel PRR Three Rivers Fast Freight set that has its own transformer . The new set has real train sounds that is controlled by this transformer . I am a complete novice at this . I can set up one train with no problem but running two I have never attempted . <p> I was hoping to run both trains with one transformer . Can someone point me to a reference on how to wire my layout to accomplish this ? Due to financial constraints I do not want to purchase expensive new hardware if at all possible . <p> BUT , If you run on 2 separate loops , 1 train per loop , just wire one transformer to each loop . <p> If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one at a time , Use the Newer Transformer and use a toggle switch to kill power to the siding where the other train is parked . Just pull the pin / connection to the siding at the switch and run power to the center rail from a toggle or such switch . <p> Alternately , remove the engine not in use , no switch and siding needed for this . <p> If you want to run both trains at once on the same track , you are going to have difficulty with conventional engines . <p> If can be done , start them spaced equally around the track and use the Newer transformer . Turn up the power until they both move . See which one goes faster and add another car to that train . Or add a bit of weight to the fast one . This will take a lot of trial and error . <p> Now , to really get this 2 trains on one track you need command control engines and the matching command system . <p> Lionel sells Legacy , MTH sells DCS. they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but each will not control the other 's engines ( MTH can control TMCC by adding a cable and a TMCC base ) <p> Thanks for that info Russell . Like the OP , I am fairly new to trains ( about 5 years into it but with limited " play " time ) . <p> When I want to run more than one train , I set-up separate track loops with their own power . For newbies and folks like me who only run their trains a few times a year , it works fine . But I want to get more into the hobby -- that requires time and budget . <p> I plan to upgrade to the MTH DCS system and add the TMCC Command base so I can operate both MTH DCS equipped trains and Lionel TMCC equipped trains . <p> My question is this : when running TWO separate trains on the SAME TRACK using DCS/TMCC , does the system keep the train speeds synchronized so that they do not overtake and crash into each other ? Is this an automatic feature or does one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work ? <p> Note : I currently have only one MTH DCS engine . I have several Lionel conventional engines . I am about to have one of the Lionel engines and tender ( Hogwarts Express ) upgraded to TMCC using Electric RR 's technology . If it works well , I will upgrade a few of my other conventional Lionel engines to Electric RR 's Cruise Command system . <p> Terrence ; If both engines are command control , once they are set , they should hold speed and thus stay clear of each other . Setting a TMCC engine to run the same speed with an MTH engine takes some adjustment and observation . You definitely want the TMCC in 128 step mode.Setting 2 PS2 or PS3 engines to run together is as simple as dialing up the same speed on the remote . Watch them the first time , some run a tad faster or slower than commanded , but seem to be consistent once you find the value to use . Most run right on speed . <p> There is also a way to set up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tracks using a different engineering method , it will however take an investment into a MTH Z4k Transformer , side receiver and DCS . Once you set this up you will never want to return to another type of control method . After the investment you will be able to run both your Conventional and DCS trains on the same tracks via the DCS Hand Held Remote Control , its simply a way cool way to control your train layout . TMCC can also be controlled in this manner with the proper gear . <p> PCRR/Dave 175857 @qwx375857 <p> Terrance , I run Legacy , TMCC ( ERR kit ) , and Proto2 engines on the same track . Even if you use all Proto2 ( with the " ALL " command to start them up at the same speed ) the engines may not run without the " faster " catching up to the " slower " consist . With my 40 plus Proto 2 engines all but 2 run within one smph of each other . I even have one loop that will run with 3 Proto 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than 45 minutes without adjusting the slack between trains . My average over 17 foot loops is somewhere 10-15 minutes before I have to adjust the slack on any particular loop . As someone mentioned the 128 TMCC speed steps , those will permit you to adjust the TMCC consist with a bit of more grandularity than you have with DCS . Specifically this example with Legacy 's 200 speed steps illustrates this point where my road engines ( both diesels and steam ) run between 37 and 40 speed steps to match my proto2 consists in front of them running at 10 smph . Switchers and subways have different ratios of comparision with Proto 2 smph with my Genset switcher running at speed step 24 to match my Proto2 Rdg 3 unit MU at 3 smph . You have a lot of speed steps to get a closest match to the proto2 speed . Note even with this there is not a " nuge " factor whereby you can tweek to consists to run at exactly the same speed and the slack between trains will eventually have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @qwx375862

So Thomas can run with the big boys <p> I have one of the basic sets for my 3 grandkids , it came with loco , two coaches , and some track it has the 80 watt transformer with a whistle only for sound . I bought some extra fastrack and turnouts and added a few O-27 cars so they can do some switching . It 's been a very reliable little loco and has made it thru much play time.My oldest is 12 yrs and I think I bought the set when she was 2 , the youngest is 6 so Thomas needs to survive for about 6 more years : &amp;gt .... DaveB <p> I have the transformer controlled , so I can run it on any of my tracks . If I used the remote controlled I would have to dedicate one track for it . So Thomas can run with the big boys <p> That would seem to be dependent on the default configuration of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run Thomas . <p> If one runs TMCC/Legacy/DCS , my understanding is that the Lionchief remote sets can coexist on those tracks since they all run on 18VAC and the signals from each system do not interfere with one another . You can run with your existing power sources and just not use the power pack that comes with the set . <p> If one had the set without the remote , you need a way to change the voltage ( depending on whether you use bricks or a ZW-C or ZW-L , of course if you remove whatever previous power supply you had for a loop , the CW-80 included with the set fits this need ) . With straight bricks ( 18 VAC constant ) , Thomas would fly around the layout at warp speed with no control over how fast he goes . <p> So it is very dependent on your setup and it 's flexibility . <p> I do n't have one of the Lionchief models , but I think I recall there may be some background sounds included with those . The traditional transformer controlled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ) , I 'm pretty sure . <p> The LionChief has more sounds and is the current production model , so I 'd go with that one . Thomas will operate down to around 10-12 volts , so you can use it on a conventional layout as well , using the remote that comes with the set . It is much more compatible with command equipped layouts ( TMCC , Legacy , DCS ) than the conventional model . If you have a conventional layout , you can control the conventional loco on a big loop with the transformer , and Thomas with the remote simultaneously . Really no downside to the LionChief version in my view . <p> I 've got the remote locomotives , one of each to be given for birthdays and Christmases over the next couple years for my now 2 year old . He 's got Percy and Diesel right now and love to run Percy . They have background sounds and very nice low speed control , as long as the voltage is n't at max on my ZW-C . I normally have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them at full throttle and that limits the top end speed . It can be run with conventional and command locomotives , I do both . The only ting that frustrates him is that it does n't respond to the throttle wheel instantaneously , just like all LC locomotives . <p> I will note though that if you are running the LionChief Thomas or friends engines on a layout with other trains running TMCC.DCS etc. it will run just fine or conventional layout down to 6-8 volts . <p> Also they might not make it through some of the longer turnouts without stalling out . <p> You should be aware though that if you do not watch the kids they can try to turn the speed control knob on the hand held remote around to make the train go faster .

@@36015057 @5015057/ <h> O-scale welding and machine shop <p> The last couple of years I have been making model buildings for a future O-scale train layout . For the most part , I have n't been finishing the inside of these buildings and have the windows frosted over . My reasoning for this is that the train tracks will be mostly at the front of the layout and the buildings will be set farther back where it is n't easy to see inside them . This also makes each building cheaper to build so I can afford to make more buildings . <p> Packed away in my train stuff , I have some O-scale lathes , mills , grinders , drill presses and other machine shop equipment . So I 'm going to build a machine shop and have the doors open and the windows clear so the interior shows . This machine shop will be mounted somewhere at the front of the layout so it will be easy to see inside it . <p> I want something a little different from the normal square cornered building so this one is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angle from the front of the building . I 'll mount it an area where the track curves away from the road so the side of the building will be parallel with the tracks and the office will be square with the road . <p> Ray , That is an awesome building and appears to me like something you would see in a welding " industrial site " .

As well as a couple of questions . <p> He is a adamant Lionel user , ONLY wants and has Lionel products and does NOT want any other manufacturers products on his layout . ( I tried to have an open mind about DCS as a compatible system , but wants nothing to do with it , that 's his choice so I will comply with his wishes . ) <p> Transformers - He has the new ZW=L and a ZW-C with 4 bricks . ( Way more power than needed , but wants both transformers in the configuration . ) <p> Throttle A - Track 2 ( As he would stand at the control panel Track 1 would be at the far left . Therefore since the D throttle is at the far left on the transformer allocated the transformer to correspond to the layout orientation . ) <p> Throttle B - Accessory Control 10v Power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Control 14v Power ( high voltage accessories ) <p> Throttle D - Track 1 ( outside loop ) <p> ZW-C - ( Transformer 2 ) <p> Throttle A - Layout Lights ( Buildings and lights , using throttle A because it is farthest right , and easier to adjust than any of the B or C throttles due to the handle length . ) <p> Throttle B - Ross Switch Power ( 14-15 v ) <p> Throttle C - TBD ( Not used at this time , possibly dedicated usage for a turntable ) <p> Throttle D - Track 3 ( Inside loop and sidings . All sidings and bypasses are under independent toggle switch control " on/off " . ) It would be inconceivable for him to operate more than two or three sidings at the same time , so not concerned about a heavy power draw . <p> Questions : <p> 1 . Should the transformers be reprogrammed other than the default values ? <p> 3 . I believe handles A and D become ineffective when the ZW-C detects the signal from Legacy , and is only varied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then handle D is a poor choice for Layout Lights . <p> 4 . When conventional operation is desired it seems the Legacy system would need to be turned off ? Unless you can vary the track power with the Red Knob , hence programming . <p> 5 .

Operating Legacy on say Track 1 , and conventional on track 3 is not really feasible . <p> Now I 'm getting confused , I need a good source of information and instructions on setting up the transformers , any suggestions ? <p> I 'm trying not to be vague but with all the variables it gets real confusing quickly . Thank you for any thoughts or suggestions . <p> 3 . I believe handles A and D become ineffective when the ZW-C detects the signal from Legacy , and is only varied by the Red Knob on the remote .

Thank you for any thoughts or suggestions . <p> For question #1 , yes . For #2 , yes , unless you set up the ZWs in manual mode . <p> I believe all four terminals on each ZW come programmed #1 through #4 . If you program them with #0 , they will be in manual mode and will not respond to the Legacy remote . You could program either , both , or neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change which terminal you are controlling by hitting track on the remote and its I 'd # . The handles set the maximum voltage in this mode . I do n't think you can have half a ZW in remote mode and the other half in command mode . <p> If you are not planning to use the remote to control track voltage , then set both ZWs to I 'd #0 . You can still use the Legacy remote to operate command engines on fixed voltage tracks . I would not use handle A or D for accessories or lights , since they are best used to vary track voltage , but it will work if you decide to go that route . <p> Questions # 4 and 5 are not correct . <p> Do you need the ZW manuals ? They should be downloadable on the Lionel website . Also , programming is really easy following the directions . You do n't need to take the ZWs in . <p> On the ZW-C with four bricks , all four outputs can be set at 18volts or less if desired . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only because they are easier to manipulate to control trains . He has output C open and can set that to 18volts . I think the Z4000 has the lower voltage limit on the B and C outputs , but not the ZW . <p> Would the operator be opposed to controlling conventionally at the transformer ? <p> Does the owner have the optional Volt/Amp meters on the ZW-C ? <p> The easiest setup is to put both transformers in manual mode- the term is Conventional ( using the switch on the transformer ) for the ZW-L and Manually for the ZW-C ( programming it to TR #0 ) . <p> Then use the handles and set the desired voltage for it 's assignment . <p> This enables the layout power to be controlled by one switch . <p> If a need arises to operate a conventional train , one just powers down the handle for the track , places the engine on the track or enables a siding and operates with the handle . <p> If the operator wishes to control a conventional train with the remote , turning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power is applied to the transformers , the A &amp; D channels of the ZW-C and the A , B , C , D channels of the ZW-L must be dialed to the desired voltage each time . This requires having both transformers in command mode . ( yes to ZW-L TR 1-4 and ZW-C TR 5-8 ) <p> This would become annoying for the option of infrequently controlling a conventional engine with a remote . <p> The answers to the 3 questions will tell you what the operator thinks he wants . You could present to need to set the voltage on 6 outputs each time an operating session begins to confirm that they really want to operate conventionally with the remote . It would also require that the ZW-C be equipped with the optional Volt/Amp meters to make the process more convenient . They are built in with the ZW-L . <p> Output Assignment consideration : <p> It would be convenient to have the loop adjacent to yard for conventional running if the yard is a storage yard with complete trains and the operator desires to bring one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continue to operate in command mode . <p> Get this solid , then examine the existing wiring and discuss the connections separately . The answer to one of your questions is all U 's are tied together and the command base can stay on . Connect the base to the ZW-L built in connector or the U for the A post on the ZW-C . <p> Don , You can really do anything you want , do n't over think this . I would say : just phase transformers , use the L for heavy lifting and C for the minor stuff . Remember constant use of ZW-C handles can cause issues if early model . AS mentioned A &amp; D start at zero regardless of throttle position , while B &amp;C come on at throttle setting . Hence I use the B&amp;C for accessories . A and D for track . Let the remote do everything else . G <p> 1 . Reprogram both transformers with A I 'd # at 0 . Preventing have to dial up each of the primary legs on start-up . <p> 2 . Move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ D to to throttle C. Still give ability to raiser and lower layout lights , without excessive use of throttle D. <p> With those two changes I think it will provide best control of the layout , AND the easiest for him to understand and control . <p> Reply to specific comments : <p> George S - You and the other posts helped me get my head straight regarding the Programming options . Thanks ! I do have a copy of the manuals but was having difficulty applying in my mind which mode would be best . Thanks ! <p> Graz ( Mike ) - Think I will go back to Xfmr 1 and have B &amp; C set at 12 and 16v , then the lights ( xfmr 2 , c ) at 10v . My thinking is he could adjust all the lights to either a bright or low setting . And for Conventional with the xfmrs in manual mode he can adjust the voltage from the throttle , and control the engines through the remote on other tracks . <p> George S - I was thinking that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ C channels that the lights would make the most sense with the D handle . But I do n't  want to promote excessive wear either . <p> Moonman - Regarding your 3 questions , 1 . ) He has been collecting and buying for 30 years , not run anything ! And decided he now wanted to set it all up . 2 . ) I do n't  think he would have an issue with operating conventionally at the transformer . If he subsequently would prefer using the button , I can reprogram the transformers at that time , explaining he will need to always dial them up . 3 . ) No he does not have the optional meter for the ZW-C , ( I do n't  think they are available anymore , ) CARL , really appreciate the expanded explanation you provided . What you described is exactly what I wanted to do ! <p> GGG - George , I share your initial statement about over thinking it with my wife . She commented , " How did he get to know you so well ?

Thanks <p> Thanks again all , this forum is great ! Hope I can help someone else as much as you guys have helped me . <p> In setting the transformers to manual / conventional mode , Carl points out that there is a switch on the ZW-L . I have the older ZW-C , so I just checked the manual . I think you just need to flip the switch on the ZW-L , where the ZW-C requires programming it to I 'd #0. 175854 @qwx375854 175853 @qwx375853 <h> Block 175862 @qwx375862

@@36015063 @5015063/ <p> I do n't know if train smoke will set them off but I have had mine go off in the garage when firing up my Halloween fog machines so I guess it is possible if it gets heavy enough since they are essentially the same thing as a smoke unit just bigger . <p> I did go to a few fog machine sites and some of them have info on fog machines setting off smoke detectors . <p> ***************** <p> Question:Will the fog machine set off my fire alarm ? <p> Answer : Generally , fog machines will trigger optical fire/smoke detectors . These detectors work by looking for interference in a light beam within the detector . Other detectors , such as ionization , infrared ( IR ) , heat , UV and CO detectors , generally will not be triggered by fog machines . However , infrared detectors may be triggered by the heat produced by the fog machine itself . <p> ****************** <p> There are 2 basic classes of smoke detectors , each with 2 main sub-classes . <p> 1 : Particle Detection - the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most common - they are the sort found in the roof of most homes , and most of the detectors tied into fire control boards are ionisation . Smoke machines of any description will set these off once the air reaches a certain saturation of particles ( generally not overly high ) . Photo-electric are also known as beam detectors . They generally work by a laser beam being shot at a detector , and as particles occlude the beam , the detector triggers - haze is generally fairly safe , but smoke machines will eventually set them off . <p> 2 : Heat based detectors - the two classes are Rate of Rise and Set-point . It is all in the name really - RoR detectors will trigger when the temperature in the room raises faster than a set rate . Set-point detectors will go off when a certain temperature is set . A classic example of a set-point system is the fire sprinkler system . Neither of these will be set off by smoke machines or hazers . <p> If you have any type 1 detectors - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is compromising the installed fire-supression system and should an emergency occur will often involve lawsuits for all involved . 99% of systems will have some form of issolation available at the fire control pannel . Talk to the venue manager about it . If it is not available , your solution is simple . No haze . <p> ********************** <p> I guess you 'll just need to test it out to see if yours are really sensitive or not and also how much smoke you generate since they all detect particles in the air regardless of what they are made of . 175852 @qwx375852 <p> Our trains have never set off our smoke alarm system , 4 MTH engines at full smoke for 15 minutes did n't do it . Aligning with Jerry 's post above , we must have a very sensitive ionization system , a spritz of nonstick cooking spray on a hot pan will set it off for sure . <p> My smoke detector went off on the one occasion where I was really putting out smoke ( four locos , all good smokers ) , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when running smoke ( which has been seldom up to now but might change ) . <p> There are a lot of smoke detectors out there that can be purchase . IMO , properly maintained , a huge leap forward in preventing fire and smoke injury . <p> Simple requirements , one per floor , one per bedroom . Local jurisdictions may require more . They can be purchased as AC , 110 volt power , with a 9 volt battery back-up . They usually ( cherp ) when the battery needs replaced . Most residential AC powered smoke detectors that I have installed are/or can be interconnected with a three wire with ground NM Cable . There is a limit to the number that can be interconnected . When one sounds , they all sound . Some require cleaning maintenance . <p> You can also purchase CO ( Carbon Monoxide ) detectors or combination Smoke/Carbon Monoxide detectors . The CO detectors , IMO , can be a bit nerve-ing , they seem to produce a lot of false alarms . Again IMO . CO detectors may be required , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoke detector displays . Mike CT <p> It 's funny , I just repaired a smoke unit on my old MTH S-2 and my wife commented on how it was a good thing we did n't have any smoke detectors yet ( Just bought the house . ) . I 'm thinking about getting one of the new Nest ones that 'll talk to my phone so that if the trains do set it off , I can turn it off . <p> Unfortunately my room is too small to run the smoke units on my two engines . The smoke sets off my wife 's asthma . I do not have a window to easily put in an exhaust fan . Secondly , since our smoke detectors are part of our home security system , the fire department is called , and I really have to call in fast to head off a fire department dispatch . Therefore , I turned the smoke units off . 175854 @qwx375854 175853 @qwx375853 <h> Block 175862 @qwx375862

I 've never been able to tell because I 've also read of problems with certain designs and did n't know how that affected future purchases . <p> I would like to learn more about CSX and all the big operators . I 've bought books of their past , current modern diesel books , and Trains magazine . I ca n't always get the inside info like the type that seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't think CSX has purchased a new EMD diesel since about 2002/2003 but they continue to rebuild GP40s and SD40s . What gives ? Think they are the only major railroad not purchasing new EMD diesels . They even had a Helms Leasing SD40 on the property the other day . <p> Simply put , the soundness of the design and reliability of the product makes the rehabilitation of these EMD units an attractive option from a financial and operational perspective for CSX and other roads . <p> Well the main thing I have heard is that the SD80MAC has a lot of vibration problems in the cab , making CSX not use them as much as they would like to . I also heard that the SD70MAC might also be doing the same thing and are due for an overhaul , but do n't quote me on that . As for the SD70ACe , I heard that CSX just does n't give them the " tender loving care " they need when it comes to service/maintenance and a lot of engineers predict they will eventually begin to fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look a little more " run-down " when compared to some of the GE units , even in the yard ( pics below ) . This is why I think CSX does not like EMD AC units that much . I do n't know if it is a maintenance thing or just pure neglect , either way I hope that they take care of these locomotives and soon , because the SD70ACe and SD80MAC are my favorite locomotives or all time along with the AC6000. 175852 @qwx375852 <p> Like many of the other Railroad companies , CSX has been rebuilding/refitting a lot of their locomotives to save money . They cosider it to be more cost efficient than buying new locomotive contracts . Unfortunately , it also means that even with older locomotives being rebuilt , they still require longer and more extensive maintanence checks , increasing the maintanence costs making the cost efficiency of this process vanish . <p> Also , it has been known that when it comes to EMD AC units CSX is not the biggest fans of them ( primarily their SD70MAC 's , SD70ACe 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes DC units ( SD70M-2 's ) I hardly believe that CSX would buy them based on their experience with the 70ACe 's . I 'm not really sure what the main reason is that CSX does not buy EMD as much , but my guess is because they feel that they get better operation , longer production life , or even a better deal with GE locomotive . That is probrably why CSX has been known to buy more GE units than EMD , giving CSX the moniker of being " the BNSF of the east . " <p> I have seen sd70s match with dash wc8 or 9 . And I havw seen the csx sd40 rebuild not to bad looking.I once saw a single csx sd70 pulling a far sized freight train coming out of charottle nc toward monroe nc.Which happens to be my hometown. 175854 @qwx375854 175853 @qwx375853 <h> Block 175862 @qwx375862 
@@36015066 @5015066/ <h> LionChief Remote and Engines <p> Is a LionChief remote limited to controlling only the engine that it comes with , or can it address other engines too ? I think they might be engine specific . <p> " LionChief Remote Control locomotives can run on any LEGACY , TMCC , or conventional transformer layout as long as 18 volts of power is being supplied to the track . Families can run their locomotives at the same time and on the same track ! At 18 volts -- Mom or Dad 's LEGACY/ TMCC engine can be controlled with the CAB-1 or CAB-2 Remote Controller while the junior engineer commands the LionChief remote locomotive with their very own remote controller . ' <p> I figured that , I was being a bit facetious . I still ca n't get over my disappointment that they did n't just do something like basic TMCC in these sets so you could integrate them into a larger layout and use your TMCC/Legacy system to control them . I get the terrible feeling Lionel is slipping back into the MPC era with cheap junk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pull that off . These are starter sets , period . they ca n't even run in conventional . This is a way to make a budget remote control set as a way to introduce kids to a more modern way of model railroading while keeping the price point within reason . <p> I guess my point is that MTH managed to put out sets at a similar price point and include the full command capability . Even if they made a " basic " TMCC set that emulated the MTH DCS Remote Commander and included the command in the locomotive , they 'd be way ahead , and so would the purchaser . They 're not that cheap compared to the competition , that 's my point . <p> In any case , I doubt I 'm going to change anyone 's mind , so I 'll move on . <p> A ) The basic ps-2/ps3 controller requires that you reprogram the engine to factory defaults to go back to the starter set mode . <p> B ) Think about DCS in " passive mode " . Or better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run directly off a laptop without any special interface , aka direct signal injection onto the track . <p> C ) If you want to see sticker shock , watch what happens when mom or dad takes the non functioning starter set engine in and they learn that it will cost almost as much to fix as they paid for the original set . <p> MTH keeps the price point down by shifting costs " downstream " . The toy is cheap to produce because ALL of them use the same electronics package . Once something happens to that package the repair/replacement costs is much higher in terms of labor and parts . <p> Because you would need a command base to pull that off .

Please the tired old scout loco and the cheaper rs santa fe diesel.Mth has the railking imperial set engine the sd70ace and it is a better loco with ps2 included Than the lionel diesels they offer . The mth engines have better motors , electrol-couplers . More diecast parts ect.Lionel uses cheap can motors and cheap plastic trucks and couplers plus a cheaper smoke unit in the steamer line . Mth steamers all have proto smoke and full ps2 sounds and speed control . The mth sets with the better engines are more likely by the consumer to be incorporated into there expansion of there railroad empire than the engine and cars in lionels low end starter sets . Just my opinion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time talking a new hobbyist OUT of buying an MTH starter set . I like the fact that , as John said in another post , the MTH starter loco does n't become an orphan when you graduate to a full command system and layout . <p> I understand you point Chuck but a massive failure should be a rare occurrence and may even be covered as a warranty repair . <p> MTH keeps the price point down by shifting costs " downstream " . The toy is cheap to produce because ALL of them use the same electronics package . Once something happens to that package the repair/replacement costs is much higher in terms of labor and parts . <p> I personally see nothing wrong with using a universal board set in the locomotives , I think it 's a good idea .

As far as the electronics failing , that can happen to any unit , and I do n't see the MTH locomotives raining out of the sky with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As far as the RTR sets with the wireless remote , I see the Lionel models as disposable toys for the most part and the MTH sets being able to be used for an expansion . <p> But - a question I have is ' Do these LionChief ' units run on track other than fastrack ? I mean the pictures show a completely different hookup track for the power . Is it just a mini-jack terminal track , meaning one would cut off the end , and simply hook up the 2 wires to the mth lockon ? <p> I also noted , after hearing the 0-8-0 run on youtube , I am at least impressed with the fact that the sound seems to be on , instead of the asinine interruptions that the other ' railsounds ' units have . <p> These locomotives will work on any three rail track as long as you have sufficient voltage present on the rails ( about 10-18 volts from what some people have posted ) .

If " control " includes direction , you could bypass the sliding bump-activated reversing switch in the trolley with an electronic reversing unit board ( 2 wires AC in from track , 2 wires DC out to motor ) . <p> If you can operate this the only device on the track , you can hook the track voltage directly to the DC motor ( again bypassing the bump switch ) and use an HO DC transformer . HO transformers have a direction switch on them which changes the polarity of the voltage on the track and hence the direction of the trolley 's DC motor . 175854 @qwx375854 175853 @qwx375853 <h> Block 175862 @qwx375862

Most digital cameras have a bracket mode that will take a 3 or 5 exposure bracket if you set your camera for a 5 step bracket and a 2/3 stop increment one of the exposures would have been right . Or just take a look after each shot and adjust the exposure manually . If you review your pix in the camera you can delete the poor exposures as your day progresses . The other big problem is the camera is moving in each photo you need a tripod or at least a monopod which is about 75% as effective as a tripod , much easier to haul around and less likely to have someone tell you not to use it in their facility .

@@36015093 @5015093/ <p> Technically , yes , they can as they are the same gauge . However , it might be more trouble than it 's worth .

@@36015095 @5015095/ <h> Grade Crossing with gates and flashers advice <p> I 'd like to include a grade crossing in my non-permanent Lionel tubular track layout . It 's a layout that is set up on the occasional weekend then put away . <p> I was originally planning to buy a grade crossing then buy separately a pair of auto crossing gates . I 'd also like a ringing bell . The FasTrack Grade Crossing with Gates and Flashers 6-12062 appeals as an all-in-one solution . I read an old thread that talked about joining Lionel tubular O gauge track to FasTrack using transitions pieces 6-12040 . I guess this would require some adjustment to the height of the tubular track . I like the look of the Lionel 153IR as a controller . However I still have n't found a nice grade crossing to go one of the options for crossing gates . <p> Does anyone have any suggestions for an all-in-one grade crossing with gates , flashers and bells from another manufacturer ? I mainly run Lionel prewar and immediate postwar , so I do n't mind an older @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talked about joining Lionel tubular O gauge track to FasTrack using transitions pieces 6-12040 . I guess this would require some adjustment to the height of the tubular track ... <p> Here ' the 6-12062 in action . Included are two 5 " insulated track sections , so the total length is 20 " . Add to that two FasTrack to tubular transition pieces . Has a switch to turn off bell . On a short run loop , does get a little annoying . Anyway , this video may help you decide . TW 175852 @qwx375852 <p> Thanks for the video . I really appreciate being able to see it in action . I like it ! It looks good and you do n't have to worry about individual components moving out of location in a temporary layout . <p> I guess if you want the boom gates to activate earlier , it 's just a case of adding more insulated track before the crossing ? I read the manual online and it says " If you would like your trains to activate the accessory earlier or to prolong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purchase Insulated Track sections ( 6-12027 ) . " I suppose it would be challenging for this extra insulated section to be made out of tubular track ? <p> Thanks again TEDW . I 'm pretty clear on making insulated tubular track sections . I was wondering if I had insulated tubular track each side of the crossing whether it then required a small section of isolating FasTrack on the outside of that ? Could n't quite imagine it from the diagram in the manual and I did n't want to be converting to and from FasTrack more than once . <p> In the diagram below , are the isolated FasTrack sections with the break part of the actual crossing or separate pieces joined to it ? 175852 @qwx375852 <p> Thanks for this photo TEDW . That helps . I can see the breaks in the outside rail closest to the camera . So if I did n't use these outside pieces and substituted FasTrack transition pieces to minimise the amount of FasTrack , I could then attach insulated tubular track as far away from the crossing as I wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been pondering your project . Using an approach that takes individual parts would create a lot of work and would not have the bell . There are other parts and systems available , the link is just one . It would also complicate the temporary setup requirement . <p> So , let 's stay with this Lionel crossing . <p> Let 's remove the 5 " pieces , like you are thinking . next problem - how to join the pins of tubular to FasTrack without the transition piece . This is not a tough project . <p> When you access the underside of the crossing section , you 'll see tabs holding the rails on - like all FasTrack . Bend those straight and the rail can be lifted up . This permits removal of the joiner pins . Then , push/ hold the rails down and rebend the pins . example here <p> The next step is to use a 7/64 " drill bit . Align it to the inside top of the rail and clean out the plastic in the end about 3/16 " inch deep . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ document from LCCA Modular specs appendix , steps 4 &amp; 5 ) <p> Now you can insert an O gauge pin into the FasTrack crossing section . <p> Next use the insulated O rail tubular track and create the approach/trigger tracks of the desired length . <p> Now , there should be only the grade crossing section in FasTrack that is triggered by an O tubular rail in a compact package for temporary setups. 175852 @qwx375852 <p> So , let 's stay with this Lionel part . The 5 " sections are the Lionel 6-12060 Block sections . There are removable jumper wires for each rail . <p> Carl , I might be quibbiling here , but the 5 " sections on the crossing are n't the 6-12060 . They have no jumper and no part number . Just says " 5 " isolator " . Barely readable on the left side of picture . Your process should work the same however . <p> Carl , now that I have climbed down off my high horse , I have modified and placed a 5 " FT section and curve section @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The crossing only triggers when it hits the crossing itself . Put the isolator section back in and it works per normal . Neither of my modified pieces extend the trigger of the crossing . I must be doing something wrong here . 175852 @qwx375852 <p> The approach with all FasTrack is a little different when you want to extend the trigger area . <p> It is between the two cut rails in the factory arrangement . Notice there are no groundstraps connecting the outside rails on the bottom of the 5 " isolator piece . <p> The technique is to lengthen the space between the main crossing piece and the 2 1/2 " to the cut in the rail . <p> Remove the groundstraps from the pieces that you want to use as extenders . Do n't remove all of the pins . This is the same as putting the paper under one outside rail of tubular track . This requires straightening the tabs , removing it and rebending the tabs . <p> Then , on the last piece of the extension , farthest from the main gate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only , cut the outside rail or put the 5 " isolator as the first straight . This creates the longer trigger rail section connected by the wheels . 175854 @qwx375854 175853 @qwx375853 <h> Block 175862 @qwx375862

Did anyone else get theirs ? <p> I agree that it better to wait and get them right . Apparently the wait was n't long enough because a very obvious problem that I pointed out to Jerry Kimble two years ago was NOT corrected . Mentioning the specific problem here will do nothing to resolve the issue . If you want to know what it is you can review my posts . <p> As small at your picture is I can clearly see the flaw . That is how obvious it is . I am finished with Atlas F units . They had one chance , and nearly 3 years , to get these right and they failed . <p> I 'm just curious which problem you 're referring to . It does not appear to be the grills ( they look corrected to me but then again I may not know what to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grills , then I refer back to your post of 10/21/16 LONG ... part of which read : " PLEASE do the Grills and we can live with the others . " If it is the grills , then I 'd appreciate a description of the error . <p> BTW , my compliments to John Handlogten on his photo . At first glance , I thought it was a prototype photo . The lighting and the backdrop both make the model look convincingly real . <p> I have received several emails asking that I explain the problem(s) . As I stated earlier I will not do it in this or any future topic on the OGR Forum as it was not fixed and it is too late now . <p> As long as the buyer is satisfied , that is really all that matters . <p> PEACE . <p> You been around here long enough to know the one thing that can not go unanswered is " I know something you do n't know " .

You 're right satisfied purchasers will never know the difference so it is just better to say nothing . <p> But the mistake here is that SANTAFEJIM opened his mouth about a flaw that he says is not corrected without identifying it knowing it would stir things up here once more . Just saying " search my previous threads " to identify the flaw is not a good way to state one 's case on why they choose to buy a certain product or not . He ( SANTAFEJIM ) has been here long enough to know people are going to want to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right out and say it despite it apparently is " on the record " in previous posts he has made but so far nobody here can identify the flaw so it must not be so obvious to anybody but SANTAFEJIM . Sorry but SANTAFEJIM 's handling of this could have been better . <p> I agree he should have just said nothing .

Close coupling is on the list . <p> For me , this posted photo of the Santa Fe ABBAs looks terrific . I am ignorant of the many fine nuances between various versions and modifications to the F series engines throughout the years . I know I no longer care for the squinty windshields of PW Lionel 's , but do appreciate Lionel 's scale F3 units that are not too ' tall in the saddle ' as some are . <p> Guys like Doug ( LOS ) , Ron H , Marker , and Mario S. have all raised my expectations with their amazing modifications @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've somewhat followed the threads on the Atlas and Sunset diesels here and gained a lot of good information from all of you . <p> $1400 for a pair of diesels is normally out of my league but the announced PA 's have motivated in me a desire for accuracy and curiosity about the horizontal drive system has me setting up a savings account for a pair of Scott 's D&amp;H Alcos . <p> I have had reasonable luck with Atlas O engines at the turn of the century . However , sometime in 200x , I ordered an Atlas Amtrak dash-8 that never showed up . As a matter of fact , Charles Ro called me about 4 or 5 years later saying that it was n't going to happen and cancelled my order . <p> But recently in 2010 , I ordered two Atlas Trainman engines , an NH RS-3 and a BNSF dash-8 . In 2014 I called Charles Ro and told them they should probably cancel the order . They said , " No , we expect it to be here next month " . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new Lionel stuff and I said that you should probably cancel the Atlas order . They said , " No , one of your engines has actually been delivered " . And sure enough , I got the NH RS-3 a week later . I ran it at the SD3R layout and it 's a nice engine . It has the ERR TMCC and smokes just fine . <p> Based on my experience with Atlas O engine delivery , I expect the BNSF dash-8 to arrive sometime during the year 2035 . I may have to update my credit card a few times , but if I 'm still alive I will take delivery of the engine and check it out . In the meantime , if I need something quick , I can just order some new Lionel stuff that takes 1 to 2 years to deliver . <p> So am I just too comfortable with the passage of time , or did I see the movie " Interstellar " too many times . <p> Hehe , if we only ordered or purchased what we " needed " all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The blurring of the lines between " need " and " want " is what keeps them in business . <p> I ripped out the " Got ta pre order the new engine " needle years ago .

Knowing the difference between " need " and " want " helps . <p> My shopping list has been whittled down to detail parts ( needed to complete projects ) and the rare project car/kit that I might grab at a show for very little money and a great deal of latent fun ( wanted .... ) . <p> I do not see it as my obligation to buy stuff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have a product that will induce me to separate myself from the contents of my wallet .

I think marine operations is such an interesting aspect of railroading . <p> The once prolific , and very cool , carfloat operations between New Jersey and New York City are all but gone . Pretty sure that the only present one is New York New Jersey Rail ... a short line owned by the Port Authority of New York &amp; New Jersey .... and it crosses New York Harbor between Jersey City , NJ and Brooklyn , NY . 175852 @qwx375852 <p> I did the research , scratch built a semi scaled float bridge and rail barge in O scale . I followed methods of loading and unloading near prototypical practice . I took the layout down in years ago with some new waterfront idea plans , some more concise simple track plan with handlaid trackage and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ board(shelf) . I additionally made some barges and a small steam ship to accompany the next phase . All equipment in the dreaded standby mode . This means shelved , standstill and possibly near liquidation phase if too much time slips by ! One experiences the excitement of the build and operations of this kind with the hope that the next build may have a finer operational scheme . It will still be a point to point to point operation . The rail float acts like a yard connected diagonally to a series of tracks that go from east to west with two other yards at either end . Additionally there was an entry/exit turnout to some staging for a road switcher to bring loaded train for rail barge delivery or exchange for empties in the two yards aforementioned.A seperate switcher was on duty for exclusive barge service and yard duties on the waterfront . <p> It was really very entertaining to load or un load the rail barge . It would take about 30 to 40 minutes for this operation . Then another amount of time loading or emptying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I expect to weather the float bridge .

@@36015108 @5015108/ <h> Question for folks that have a BlueTooth equipped LC/Flyer engine and the LC app ( and/or Lionel techs ) <p> Just randomly thinking about Bluetooth and the way it works in pairing between two devices . My question is , with the engines that use bluetooth , if you have two of the same engine , will both be controlled together by one remote and/or the app as with the previous generations of LionChief/+/FlyerChief engines ? <p> It seems from what I know about BlueTooth that only one engine could be operated by a given controller at any one time . I know that this could be programed around , where the controller repeats the commands to several engines , without too much fuss . Mostly I 'm curious if with the bluetooth app , one could independently control two of the same engine ? <p> JGL <p> $ This is John Galt live for mine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remote ( or handheld device ) pairs to one engine only . So you wo n't be able to control two of the same engine with a single control channel . A positive to this though is that the communication is two-way , so the engine can send information back to the controller . This is used to check states , so an APP knows if the smoke unit is on , etc . <p> The BLE Lionchief and Lionchief plus Remotes ( and App ) can open 3 simultaneous connections . Therefore up to 3 of the same *exact* locos ( same SKU ) will operate just fine together . We also have a mechanism to operate up to 3 dissimilar products to work together in a scene , such as a loco and announcement coach ( like the polar express ) . <p> This approach will allow ABA locos to operate together , each with its own BLE radio with unique I 'd and features . The universal remote can support 3 BLE simultaneous connections as well ; which can be spread as one loco on engine select button @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on a single button . <p> When operating in this way , there is no need to disconnect ; and commands are sent to all the devices under control of the remote or app . <p> Thanks for the replies . This is pretty much what I expected . With the app , would it be possible to control two of the same engine independently as well ? I can see how doing so might get a little complex on the user interface , but it would be a nice feature . <p> I like the idea of a " lash-up " with add on cars as well , allowing the whole train to act as one unit . <p> On the technical end , is the three device limit a hold-over in the code from the design of the universal remote , or is it imposed by limitations in smart devices ? It seems like a smart phone ( or similar ) should be able to talk to more than 3 BLE devices at once ( well , one then another in a loop ) , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Edit : I suppose the compatibility with the remotes would be the limiting factor , so then , are the BLE modules in use only able to keep up with three devices , or is that a limit defined in the programing ? Based on the data sheet for the module in the universal remote , it seems like a pretty robust little processor . <p> JGL <p> $ This is John Galt live for mine .

Come see it for yourself on the SGMA layout along with an Ives Circus tent , many circus elephants , multiple Pride Lines clowns , and much more ! <p> I do n't have the tools or talents to make those custom circus wagons and side rails for use with my Standard Gauge 211 flatcars . Dave Anderson does . I approached him about making some custom wagons for placement on my 211 flatcars after purchasing several of his 1/24 G scale circus wagons on ebay . Unfortunately , these proved too wide and long to mount two on a 211 flatcar . So I contacted Dave and asked him if he could downsize them until two would fit . He said he would try . <p> So I shipped him a 211 flatcar , and after some experimentation , Dave found that two of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even allowed me to pick out which Ringling Bros and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus banners I wanted him to use on the sides of the circus wagons , and much to my pleasure , on his own initiative he produced the striking side rails . <p> As you can plainly see in the pictures above , the results of Dave 's efforts are fantastic . I liked them so much that I subsequently asked Dave to make me several sets of Buffalo Bill wagons for use in a special Buffalo Bill 's Wild West Show train I wanted to create . You will be able to see this unique train in action at Trainfest 2017 . <p> PSS . Using the below link , see my initial Buffalo Bill 's Wild West Show train running on the SGMA layout at Trainfest 2015 . Since this video was taken , Dave has produced several more Buffalo Bill wagons for me which I mounted on additional MTH 211 flatcars . These will be on display at Trainfest 2017 . <p> If you 're looking for 211 flatcars , I strongly recommend you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jigs are designed to produce parts for use with those flatcars . I do n't know if the newer Lionel Corporation flatcars are identical or not to the earlier MTH Tinplate Traditions cars , but if they are the same you could buy those cars too . <p> Be sure to purchase only the MTH ( or Lionel Corporation ) flatcars that are sold with their original boxes as with a few modifications of the interior foam , those boxes can be made to hold the modified flatcars , i.e. , flatcars with the circus siderails installed . This is important as the two circus siderails on each flatcar are relatively fragile and it 's better to leave them alone once installed rather than push/pull them in and out . 175854 @qwx375854 175853 @qwx375853 <h> Block 175862 @qwx375862

With the above two items you can select Legacy and they 'll run in Legacy mode . <p> I just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and why it 's required , as regards using Legacy engines in Legacy mode with the Premium DCS App . <p> There are 2 different scenarios : <p> Those who already have LCS installed on their layouts , need the SER2 module referenced in the initial post of this thread . However , instead of the referenced cable , what 's required is a different cable from Lionel . This would be a PDI to PDI cable that needs to be just long enough to connect the SER2 module to an existing LCS module . <p> Those who do not have LCS already installed need only the two items referenced in the initial post . However , that setup will not allow operation of either of Lionel 's two WiFi apps , LCS or iCab . Also , there is no documentation available regarding thisexact setup . I 'll provide that documentation both briefly on this thread later today and in detail in the new DCS WiFi Companion book . <p> By the way , the reason ( subject to verification ) that the SER2 is required at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TMCC commands via it 's 9-pin serial port , not Legacy commands . That 's why Legacy engines can work just fine without the SER2 module , however , only when configured in the app as TMCC engines . <p> Hopefully , I 've clarified the situation rather than confusing it further . <p> Connect an MTH #50-1032 cable between the TIU 's serial port and the SER2 's serial port using the end that would normally connect to the Legacy command base . If the TIU is already connected to the WIU using its serial port , you 'll need a simple serial Y cable with 1 male end and 2 female ends . <p> Anyone who had LCS and an SER2 installed , including Marty Fitzhenry and yours truly , had no issues at all . That 's why neither of us had any idea that there was any kind of an issue . <p> exactly . That was my scenario as well and why I was stumped why mine worked when others did n't . I did n't realize there was this issue hanging out there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assistance . <p> This is one thing I love about this place is all of us working to help get things figured out for each other ! <p> Without the above two items you can cable directly to the Legacy Base , BUT ... you can only run engines in TMCC mode . So when you select the engine type when you add TMCC/Legacy engines you 'd have to select TMCC . With the above two items you can select Legacy and they 'll run in Legacy mode . <p> MTH <p> Can MTH post a HOW-TO video on their youtube channel on how to setup this up ? <p> BTW it would be awesome if MTH would post HOW-TO Videos about such equipment on setups and troubleshooting the equipment . Such things as TIU and AIU devices and or the new Wifi App . <p> Some folks are visual learners and not all can just read a pamphlet or manual and understand all that is required . <p> Hope u all had a great York .

Btw , we run 5 TIU 's in Super mode . <p> We added a PDI to PDI cable and an SER 2 as Barry has advised . We add a Legacy engine and it does not show the address we put in . Always shows as 1 .

However , you can change the engine 's actual Legacy or TMCC ID# . <p> Barry , OK I understand the " dummy placeholder " number . However , the engines do not respond to any of the legacy commands .

Any limit on length of the daisy chain of PDI cables ? As I understand it , in general , the Legacy base can not support more than one nominal connection load . And thus the SER2 was born to buffer the Legacy base serial port as to loading . <p> This was asked at the 2013 Legacy meeting . This was the response from Jon Zahornacky . <p> JZ Yes , the supply will cover 99% of all installations . The IR tracks are 20MA loads , and we have One Amp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 300MA , and the ASC2 , BPC2 , AMC2 , etc - will draw LT 50MA . If you run out of power , we have a booster supply concept in mind to address those situations . <p> Since we have n't seen the booster I suspect there has n't been a need for it yet . <p> The other part of the question is how long the cables can be . That would be a somewhat complex computation as you 'd have to tally up all the current draws of the various components , then figure out the cable lengths and the location of each component on the network . The actual total will be highly dependent on the exact configuration of all your LCS boxes and where they appear on the daisy-chain network . If all the loads were at the end of a long cable , it 's a lot easier . Given that the WiFi will probably be pretty close to the SER2 as a rule , you are probably just looking at the other components . I 'd try to keep the cables to the ASC2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SER2 , and then the sensor tracks would probably not be much of a factor until you got fifteen or twenty of them out there . <p> Hope u all had a great York .

I do not have Lionel 's WiFi unit . <p> I understand the DCS " dummy placeholder " number ( #1 ) , and the DCS app is showing the correct Legacy ID# is set ( #92 ) . My Cab2 correctly runs TMCC/Legacy , the DCS handheld correctly runs DCS , the DCS app also correctly runs DCS ( love it ) , but the DCS app will not run TMCC/Legacy . Everything is wired per everyone 's guidance and the SER2 manual . Like Jeff , when I execute commands for the Legacy engine I see lights flashing on the WIU , SER2 , and Legacy command base . However , I get no reaction from the engine . <p> I 'll work on this again tomorrow . <p> Ron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has the DB9 port on the Legacy base connected to our 2 Track Power Controlers . How do we add the Lionel serial box to this setup ? Can we use a Y DB9 connector cable to connect the base , TPC 's , and serial box or do we have to use the screw connection on the serial box ? Thanks Bruce <p> I guess I missed it somewhere , but you can not input a Legacy/TMCC engine number higher than 90 into the DCS app . The DCS app says add a number between 1-99 , but do n't believe it . <p> I have been trying for two days to get a TMCC engine and a Legacy engine to operate with the DCS app . The TMCC engine has an address of 92 , and the Legacy engine has an address of 96 . Could not get either one to respond to commands from the DCS app , but both ran well with the Cab2 . And as I mentioned above , all the appropriate lights blinked correctly . <p> Going through all the MTH and Lionel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that said you could not load a TMCC engine number higher than 90 . Well , even though the DCS app said up to 99 , I reset the engine number for the Legacy engine to 1 through the DCS app and the engine worked . I then set the TMCC engine to 48 and it worked ( sort of , see below ) . <p> Number one recommendation to MTH on their next app update is to change the TMCC/Legacy engine number change instruction to say 1-90 ! ! ! Two days wasted . <p> By the way , the TMCC engine has its issues using the DCS app . Unlike the Legacy engine , commands are not always accepted and one time it and the app froze up with the whistle constantly on with the virtual whistle handle down . Had to shut down power and close the app to get things working again . The engine runs well with the Cab2 . I 'll try some other engines and report back . <p> Ron 175860 @qwx375860 175861 @qwx375861 175854 @qwx375854 175853 @qwx375853 <h> Block 175862 @qwx375862

@@36015138 @5015138/ <h> Using Original TMCC Cab1 and MTH Protosounds 1 engines <p> I recently purchased an MTH 260e o gauge tinplate Contemporary Version steam engine as well as an MTH SP Gs-4 engine with Protosounds ( 1 ) . They both seem to run fine and have sound using just my Lionel ZW transformer . But when I connect my older CAB 1 equipment , both engines startup and go into RESET mode ( 2 bells ) , and then the sound stops . They will run fine , but without any sound . Once in a great while , they will run and have sound but that 's rare . The GS-4 will sometimes refuse to come out of RESET mode . When I cut the power and then bring it back , the engine makes the 2 bells sound and continues to make sound until I cut the power to activate the DCRU . It goes back to RESET mode . Any ideas on how to make these engines work with the CAB1 ? Do I need an MTH controller ? Thanks for your help . BTW , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2.0 and it runs and makes sound without any trouble at all . <p> I 'm pretty sure Proto 1 does not generally play well with the original PowerMaster ( you do n't specify , but I imagine that 's what you are controlling with your CAB-1 , right ? The TPC units that came later I believe were made such that they play nicer with Proto 1 ) . <p> You could try lowering the voltage to the power master , Try getting it out of reset and running , then raise the power- masters power supply ( ZW handle ) ..... or maybe get engine running on a siding with just the zw and run it out to the track controlled by the cab-1 / power master ? <p> Had an Al Trol throttle set up years ago . Had the same issue as to not playing well with PS1 engines . The workaround solution was powering up the engine and moving it with one side of the ZW . I used a toggle and relay setup to switch over to the Al Trol which you provided a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It all worked well except you had to repeat this every time you powered the layout up . <p> Thank you all for the help . GUNRUNNERJOHN , I had suspected the battery issue and will look for new ones although I ca n't find how to access the battery in the tender of the tinplate 260e engine . And DAVE45681 , at your suggestion , I replaced the original PowerMaster with a TPC 300 and both engines now work correctly although the GS-4 does sound like the battery is dying and I have it charging to see if that gives me better sound . Whew ! ! Thank you for your help . <p> LOL . Yes , it is way past it 's sell-by date , but I got a good price on it on ebay and while the battery probably should be replaced and the smoke unit is n't working , it has a great sounding horn and has become my favorite at the moment . I 've recently changed over from decades in S gauge to O gauge tinplate and built a new layout around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learn how to repair old American Flyer trains so I guess it will take a while to figure out O gauge . I 'm glad there is a great resource here to help me learn . <p> After replacing the battery , if the PS-1 locomotives still do n't work with the PowerMaster , John will have to tell you which capacitor to put on the outputs to get the locomotive to work . I had the same issue and using the capacitor solved the issue ( But I have since long lost the cap . ) . The locomotive does n't like the power output of the stock PM and goes into a protect mode . If you lock the locomotive into a direction ( Only do after getting a new battery ! ) then it 'll work just fine with the PM as it does n't run the power check in that mode .

@@36015141 @5015141/ <h> Subway Layout Master RR-Track Plan and Elevated 3D Views <p> While I post progress of my subway layout I will like to show you the master track view . With both subway and elevated most of the subway is obscured in this view . It is an oval with 3 separate tracks ( 2 local and one express ) with 2 stations . The elevated line is also basically an oval with 3 separate tracks with a small section in the lower left which contains a curved station on an embankment . There are 2 other stations . The most interesting part of this layout is the connection between the subway and elevated lines . In order to meet clearances some complex elevated planning was required . The elevated design is not totally complete . The subway is running and I have built about 8 feet of prototype elevated that is not on the layout . Also there is a 9 track yard which has also been built . <p> I was able to build the elevated designs using RR-Track . More comprehensive designs require the use of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Meeting clearances so the elevated connection to the subway will not interfere with the elevated mainline .

Also it is very difficult to get into the detail I desire as there is considerable eye strain even with O-scale . <p> The El randitions are custom made grouped objects . Due to the limitations of the software separate objects had to be created for girders on grades . I created separate objects for lattice bracing ( i.e. 3 braces , 3 1/2 , 4 , etc . ) . <p> SketchUp is true 3D software , so the answer is YES to create El pieces in HO scale . <p> To answer your question regarding the express line as an entry point for a yard , note my design where the main lines and the section that connects to the subway do not interfere with one another and the main lines grade higher and the subway connection grades lower . You will need clearance for your yard connection to pass under one or two of your main lines . Depending on your distance between the main express line cutoff to the yard and the pass-under you may need for example the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should rise at 3 percent and your yard cutoff should decline 3 percent . Also consider a trestle for the lines that pass over your yard connection and not standard track girders as that also allows for better clearance . <p> Use Google street view to get ideas of complex elevated designs . I based my design on the Rockaway turn off from the main Liberty Ave elevated with some modifications . I was also able to calculate what radius curves in O scale to use by using the distance tool . <p> For your design look at the entrance to the Corona Yards or the Westchester Yards from the main line Els. 175854 @qwx375854 175853 @qwx375853 <h> Block 175862 @qwx375862

This allows a bit of a switching puzzle : a challenge when pulling a short mixed-freight ( about 7 cars ) leaving the yard and around the inner loop a couple of times , and then pulling back onto the yard lead/industry serving track : removing the empties , consolidating the empties , serving the industries , and then leaving with the empties with the loco at the head end to go back around the inner-track a couple of times , and then pulling back into the yard . 175858 @qwx375858 175852 @qwx375852 <p> Very nice layout ! I love the way you have tried so many options , tested and then worked through the issues sharing along the way .

He is now building his third On30 layout ! 175858 @qwx375858 <p> I added a mountain and tunnel on the right end of the layout , connecting two hills previously planned . I think that it will add drama as the trains enter/leave the tunnel as viewed from the left end of the inside access area . And the wide curves on the O-72 loop will look cool against a rock wall , and will be one of the first focal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My only criticism is that it seems a little overloaded with turnouts--it might be worth a look to see if you can eliminate some of them and still get the operation and traffic flow you want , particularly with those runaround tracks . Make every turnout work for a living and earn its keep . <p> Joker , this was designed with AnyRail , which is free to play with but for a large layout requires the license . <p> Shrink to 12 X 14 : I am sure it could be done . You might have to accept some O-36 to make it fit , but I would do that as a last resort . Swap out some of the O-72 turnouts for O-60 . Perhaps if the middle yard-lead track were eliminated , and the station ( which is large ) were eliminated , it would work . Of course the yard length would be shortened . <p> It would be easier if you can live without the access corridor on the left of the plan , then the project becomes easier . 175858 @qwx375858 <p> Looking at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Turnouts are expensive - especially the Fastrack Command Control turnouts that I want to use ( so I can switch them from my Legacy handheld ) . <p> We could save two turnouts by eliminating the 3-car runaround in the industry area . Save one by converting the powerplant siding to a spur . Two turnouts could be saved by eliminating the industries coming of the outer main line . Two turnouts eliminated by dropping the O-72 loop with removable steel bridge . That sort of thing ... Each turnout removed also drops a feature . <p> I have about half the O72 turnouts needed , but they need to be upgraded to command control with the available kit . Then I will have to purchase the rest with a second mortgate on the house . 175858 @qwx375858 <p> Joker : I worked on an 11X17 version with Atlas O. Using O-45 and O-54 curves . It fits in 11X17 and still has the O-72 perimeter route with the bridge . If you want it , I can post it with the AnyRail file . I imagine the version @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tighter turnouts than the O-72 in the above plan . 175858 @qwx375858 <p> Here is the 11X17 plan with Atlas O track , with O-45 and O-54 minimums , and the O-72 route across the steel bridge . The AnyRail file is attached . I will be interested to see what you can do with it , please post ! <p> I used three of the curved turnouts O-72/O-54 which helped save space , and are kind of cool . 175858 @qwx375858 175852 @qwx375852 <p> Here is the 11X17 plan with Atlas O track , with O-45 and O-54 minimums , and the O-72 route across the steel bridge .

You can kind of eyeball the curvature and compare the more gradual O-72 . The outer route is O-54 minimum in a couple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that are along the walls and across the bridge , I was able to make O72 . There are even some wider curves mixed in . So the outer loop with bridge includes parts of the O-54 outer route , and those sections of shared trackage are all O72 minimum . <p> You can see the difference on my 12X18 Fastrack layout above , everything that is brown track is O-72 . The gray trackage is less than O-72 . The equivalent sections of track limit the curvature on the Atlas version to less than O-72 . <p> Having the additional route across the bridge that is O-72 does n't allow for more trains to run at the same time , but it allows for O-72 locos on the layout , which otherwise would not have anywhere to run . I do n't have any locos requiring O-72 at present , but you never know what might strike my fancy in the future . 175858 @qwx375858 <p> Here is my latest version . The plan has matured to the point where changes are now small and minor , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minor change in the angle where the O-72 route to the bridge on the far right , which led to each yard track being lengthened by about 2 " , and the turntable " whisker " tracks about 1.5 inches . Small changes , but still an improvement that did not compromise the aisle widths and access . <p> I have three possible locations for this , my " retirement layout " : a garage bay ; a " teen room " that can be re-purposed after my youngest goes off to college this fall ( which is 11.5 X 19.5 ) ; and a new addition underneath a remodeled deck at the back of the house . <p> The far-left outside route has O-96 curves . 175858 @qwx375858 175852 @qwx375852 <p> I am considering adding small elevation changes with 1% grades in order to make the scenery more interesting . To this point , all track has been on the tabletop at 0 " elevation . I just returned from a trip to Denver where I took the train to Glenwood Springs through and over the " front range @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentle grades until they must pierce the mountains with tunnels . So this change below , includes 1% grades approaching and into the two tunnel areas on the double-track main lines , for an elevation of 0.5 " ( not much ) , perhaps enough to make the layout more interesting visually and for running trains . Also 0.5 " elevation for the double-track mains near the station at the far left . So the main lines meet the lower levels at 0 " elevation , and then climb up and then back down three times as the route is traversed . Elevations and grades are in RED . <p> What do you think ? Is this worth doing - the visual effect vs the hassles ? 175858 @qwx375858 175852 @qwx375852 <p> I was considering doing that on the design that I had talked about on my topic . I wanted to do two levels and you gave me some great advice with some other contributing as well . My thought was to have the second level 9 to 10 inches high , then to have the bottom level up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or such to give some look of uneven ground or something like that , or even keep the track up but make the ground sink in spots . There is some track by me where the ground overall drops off about 8-10 feet gradually and the rails and bed are built up . Eventually they do have a bridge because the drop off becomes greater that 20-30 feet . <p> This is the bridge I was talking about . Both sides have gradual drops in the surrounding land except for this larger dip . The ground on the right side of the picture comes back up for the overall elevation whereas the left side of the picture it is tapered sort of downhill in the background . This was one of the things I was originally thinking about on mine , but I am unsure if I would have a spot ( but best to keep on the back burner ) for it until I get some work done in the program . Always loved this bridge . <p> I see what you mean Dave , that is an interesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to go over the tracks , perhaps it should go underneath . I will think about that . <p> Yeah , I myself had never thought about the height differences in any layout I have set up , not even in my HO days . Sure I had the elevated trestle , but on a sheet of plywood it looks blah . I had made a mountain using a couple blocks of wood , a piece of balsa plyboard ( I think it was ) and crumpled paper painted white to simulate snow . It was amazing , I think I was 14 at the time . <p> I appreciate your thoughts Dave and Carl . One of my limitations would seem to be the type of construction - 2 " thick 4'X8 ' foam for table tops . However , I could put all track on risers to allow terrain below track level . 2 " high Woodland Scenics risers would be convenient and easy . I could use more of the 2 " foam sheets for large areas like the yard that are on the same level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grades to provide a terrain height difference . 175858 @qwx375858 <p> I appreciate your thoughts Dave and Carl .

Do n't get me wrong I do n't  expect a shake and bake kit , but this seemed a bit much to me especially at the price . <p> 3 . ) There were missing pieces and some were broken when opening the kit . Steve was prompt in sending me replacements and they arrived without incident . The broken pieces happen ca n't control how the package gets abused during shipment , however the missing pieces are just plain carelessness in Q.C . and are IMHO unacceptable . <p> 4 . ) Some of the strip lumber included in the kit is not cut to the proper length I am very meticulous and before placing and gluing each piece I measured every piece against the parts list length and in the case of many of the pieces they were off by 1/16 of an inch this may not seem like a lot but it added up on a few of the structual supports to be an 1/8 or 5/16 of an inch . This is 6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corrected . I was forced to make filler pieces to make up the gaps and keep everything true . Again not beyond my abilities but I should not have to do this amount of extra work on a fresh kit out of the box due to someone not accounting for the blade kerf or being careless when making the cuts . <p> I am not really expecting any resolution from Steve but wish to inform the Forum membership of my experience and see if anyone else has had the same issues or concerns . <p> I would consider this structure a " craftsman kit " . The pieces require sanding and fitting and can have some warpage because they are casted using urethane plastic . The missing pieces should not be expected and you said they were replaced . Craftsman type kits do not snap together and a lot of times are not easy to put together . I have been building models for over thirty years and have had my share of problems with various kit structures I have built . <p> I think that after you start getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems that you will construct a fine building . <p> I do not usually follow the manufacturers directions when I build these type of kits and work my way through the problems . I find it much easier that way . <p> I have done two of the 304 kits . and found that an accurate Complete floor was key to assembly . I also did three complete roof panels which added to the kit . Best wishes with your project . <p> This model has been around for quite some time . The original instructions , I have , date to early 1980 's . Newer kits are much improved , over the lack-of-instructions , and warped/poorly prepared , urethane panels , that were the norm , then . The mat board roof panels , that curved when glue was applied were also a sore spot . As has been noted it is still a craftsman 's kit . Best wishes with your project . <p> Not my first Korber RH kit , I got one from Justrains in Delaware several years back and built it , I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it got built none the less . This kit is way better than that one , but I guess that I was expecting a more simplified build process based on the reviews I read and at least an accurate and properly scaled drawing which BTW I did get with the old kit but not with the new one . I guess I am sayng that given the cost I expected a little more and was disappointed with the overall quality and attention to detail in the kit I received . I am quite sure that it will build into an awesome model and I will be happy I put in the effort to get it built but it just left a bad taste in my mouth you know ? ? <p> Quite frankly there was no acknowledgement of that issue at all . Part of why I am perturbed . <p> I had previously contacted Steve regarding the plans prior to purchase as I was planning on a rework of my old Korber roundhouse and wanted to purchase the plans and strip lumber to make it easier . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up ordering a new one , instead of attempting the reowrk . Steve sent a copy of the plans and a materials list via pdf graciously . So I just took that pdf file to staples and had them print it at 100pct which was the correct measurements . As I said none of this was beyond my abilty to square away but it has taken a little bit away from the joy of building the kit . As previouly mentioned I am confident that I can create a kit that is well built , and nicely detailed based on how it has been coming together thus far , I t was just a sense of disappointment in the overall experience , maybe Its me , and I expect to much . Oh well . When its done I will post pictures . Regards , 175854 @qwx375854 175853 @qwx375853 <h> Block 175862 @qwx375862 
@@36015154 @5015154/ <p> Thanks guys ! Graduation was a pretty big deal . Now both of my kids have degrees , next step is real jobs . There was another milestone that passed quietly back in January which was no more tuition to pay . <p> Unfortunately , her mother and I are not really on speaking terms , so we split our time with my daughter . That left me and my wife with some down time , so I spent part of it down by the rails . Brookings is served by a short line , the Rapid City , Pierre &amp; Eastern ( which I had never heard of prior to visiting ) . <p> It was Saturday afternoon , with zero activity , and I was able to wander freely around the operations facility . <p> If you look closely , this is a GP-38-3 <p> I found this rather interesting , and a detail that could be easily modeled . Roofing felt has been placed over the ties where the locomotive is usually parked in order to catch oil drips and prevent ground contamination . Neat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old elevators with all their additions . <p> Pat - Historically May has always been a slow month for the layout . In previous years my wife and I have taken long trips in May , so nothing got done . I now have 15 months before the convention . It 's crunch time for real . <p> Bob - It 's great to have your input on this because it comes from experience . I was actually thinking about that very issue . It is easy enough to get additional boxes . I agree , this thing is getting very close to being ready for a " guinea pig " session , where I bring in 5 or 6 guys and try to run some trains . There will be a lot of bugs , but we have to start to get to that end goal . Hosting an operating session was on my list of things to do in 2017 , and it still is . <p> John - By that standard , I 'm way ahead of the game , because I did get something done on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fairly quick and easy , especially when dealing with six packs of cars , because most of the info is just copied down and the car number and product number are the only things that change . What really takes time is the physical unpacking of the cars . Here 's the process for a 12 car coal hopper set : open the outer shipper , remove and open the inner shipper , remove and open the six pack , open the individual car box , pull out the foam or plastic insert , remove the car from the plastic bag , repeat for the second six pack finally reverse the process and store the boxes . 175852 @qwx375852 <p> Congratulations on your daughter 's graduation ! That 's a great accomplishment . Everything else is still looking like it 's coming along just fine and still looking better every month . My favorite items might be the cards , card boxes and most of all those nifty paper clips your wife found . I like the drafting arm as well . I am no where near any kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ card boxes and their cards to go with them , although I would not know what to do with them . Sometimes I am easily sidetracked . <p> Hi Elliot , I know how you feel and how a dream layout can become a little overwhelming at times . <p> But couple that with fighting cancer and it all can become very daunting not only physically but mentally as well . Something that originally gave us strength and motivation can become overwhelming if we let it . I know this because I had to deal with the cancer beast not only with myself but my wife 's breast cancer and son who had Hoskins Lymphoma . We are all doing well now but I still pray everyday things stay that way and I will add you to my daily list of favors . <p> But , it sounds as if the cancer is under control and your will is strong and back on track . I 'm happy to read that you found some help . Friends are always a great source of wisdom and strength . Also , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ project is right on . I find one hour always leads to three or four and before I knew it I was running trains . <p> Oh yea , if it means anything to you buddy I have been working on my dream since 1995 . <p> Oh man , does this bring back memories ! Countless years of use , many years ago - for both work and for my old HO layouts ! I still have all the drawing instruments , templates , mechanical pencils , leads , erasers , sharpeners , etc. , but not my drafting machine . <p> Thank you once again for the updates , and congrats on your daughter 's graduation . <p> BIGBOY4005 , It 's been a while since I 've checked into this thread and as per usual there 's been tons of progress . This is made more impressive just by the sheer size of the layout . It 's going to be beautiful when it 's done ! <p> BTW you mentioned a " guinea pig " opp. session in your near future . This is a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Rather than running trains you should be walking around taking notes ( or get someone to do it for you ) to keep track of all the issues that come up and to quickly debug the things that can be debugged on the spot . This will make the debugging process that much shorter so you can start your scenery sooner . <p> Hey guys , I 'm so sorry I did n't reply sooner . The month is almost gone , and I 'm just catching this now . Thanks for all your support . <p> RTR12 - I do n't want to tip my hand too much for the June update , but Gary came over again yesterday , and we started to formulate a plan so he could make a timetable . In the back of my mind , I have always been thinking about this , but it will soon become a reality . Gary is still a little overwhelmed by the layout , but after another four hour tour , I sent him home with a small notebook full of papers . The plot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and yours are doing well . CANCER SUCKS ! ! ! ! While mine is squarely in my rear view mirror , it cost me five years of working on the layout , by messing with my head . Unfortunately , 25 years of diabetes is really catching up to me , and there is a new monster on the horizon . As a result , I feel kind of crummy a lot of days , which kind of helps explain the slow down in progress . I think the fact that I want to see this thing run is what keeps me going . <p> Alex - Yeah , drafting tables with paper and pencil are so old school . I could just never bring myself to learn CAD . It would be so much cleaner . It is all I can do to work with MS Paint , but in the June update I 'll show everyone my creations . I still need to finish that full sheet , but it is not critical . <p> MRB - Gary brings a lot to the table , since he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An experienced crew is a big part of that . The plan is to start small , maybe three plus Gary and me . We 'll have to do orientation before we start running trains . I will be the " fireman " , running around taking notes and fixing the little things on the fly . There will be a lot of debugging before we can advance to the next step . <h> I 'll be back in ten days with my full June update . <p> I 'll be eagerly watching for the next Update ! ! Diabetes is a bad disease , follow your Dr 's orders carefully ! ! My son-in-law 's father died at a pretty young age from diabetes ( just a year or two over 60 as I recall ) , most likely because he was n't following the Dr 's orders . It is nothing to mess with , please be careful and good luck ! ! <p> Well , this topic has now been running for four and a half years . Thanks to all of you who have helped make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specific projects . Two of them were prompted by Gary , my new operations guru . The other two were physical projects for the layout that have been going on for quite a while now . <p> Let 's start with a project that began about a year ago . I cracked the whip a bit with my wife , and we finished the assembly of the SSD cards . To refresh everyone 's memory , SSD stands for Searchlight Signal Driver . These boards will be part of my signaling system , and control individual bi-color LED 's . Twelve circuits per card , one LED per circuit . We had completed nine of the eighteen cards a while ago , but it was time to finish the second nine . <p> It may be a while before I get back to these . They still need to be tested . Then the actual signals have to be built and installed , and finally C/MRI and JMRI have to be up and running . I have all the parts , stay tuned . <p> Next up , the uncoupler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be scattered around the layout . Some of the units will control as many as ten uncoupler magnets , others as few as three . There 's still a lot of work to be done to get the magnets operational , but all of the modules are up to the same point now . <p> Here I 'm making the daisy chain that will distribute the magnet power to the relays on the module . <p> This is what a simple four unit module looks like . Also this month I mounted the terminal strips , and added wires from the relays that will connect to the magnets ( not shown ) . <p> Gary requested that I provide him with " stick drawings " of the layout . I spent a couple of days using MS Paint to create these . The other thing that got done in the process was to assign names to all of the layout 's industries . There are 32 industries . I 've always had an idea of what they were , but it really brings things into better focus to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife got involved , and made a set of signs for the layout . <p> I made 23 of these drawings , and put them in a 3 ring binder . I 'm not going to post them all right now , but here are some of the more interesting ones , along with actual layout photos to go with them . <p> This drawing is just an overview of the whole layout . The layout is really a loop to loop design . The hidden yard / staging is built on a reverse loop , then there is a connecting track , ant the whole visible part of the layout is the other loop . Go around clockwise and you 're heading west , counter clockwise and you are heading east . <p> I 've posted these next three here in the past , but I thought it would help to have them handy to see again . <p> Here 's the new stuff ! <p> The plan for July is to build a large relay panel and move the hidden yard controls over to the dispatching corner , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trains . I 'd also like to start getting the uncoupler controls installed and operational . Lots to do ! <p> We just kept chipping away at those cards . We would go downstairs and put one component on all 9 cards , that 's 108 pieces , and 216 solder joints . If we were feeling good , we 'd do a second round at a sitting . <p> As for the depot cameras , they 'll probably have them fixed just about the time the Builder gets defunded . <p> I agree with GUNRUNNERJOHN . Following along with all the progress reports you have come a long way Elliot . With a layout of the size you have been building the plus factor was a group of guys you could count on for help . So when all is said and completed I would stand in line , pay for admission to see the completed layout running ......... Paul <p> Steve - Help has been hit and miss of late . Gary is my latest addition , and has been getting me started toward operations now that 95% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot to do though , most of which is electrical control . Then there 's all the scenery . Lots left to do , I 'll take all the help I can get . <p> John - I 've already done the whole " charge admission " thing , 25 years ago with enterTRAINment at Mall of America . This layout is free to visit , and open to anyone reading this . All you have to do is , get to the Twin Cities , and let me know that you want to visit . Email is best . <p> Paul - You know the old saying " a train layout is never finished " . I 'm still pushing to have this thing in shape for the National Narrow Gauge Convention , Labor Day weekend 2018 . The committee will make their final decision in March , so the heat is on . <p> Matt - At 1900 square feet , the layout is admittedly huge . Last weekend I was at a train buddy 's house , and one of the guys there said the layout is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ layout is directly related to my space back at the mall , where I had 2000 . There is a lot more space in the basement , the train room is less than half , but I chose not to take any more . Probably a wise move . This is plenty . I certainly do n't find myself wishing for more . <p> Bob - I 'd love to have you come up for an operating session once we get this thing going . Gary has an HO layout which he and his crew operate every first Friday . I 'm going to visit this week and meet the crew . I suspect that a bunch of them will become part of my crew . The talk is that we will need 12 - 15 to run this thing at full capacity . The Hiawatha job will probably be a full time position , with a dedicated switching unit , and the Minnesota Commercial ( a transfer railroad ) will deliver and pick up cars to and from that small yard at the east end . <p> Jon - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reading " ? Why do n't you come out for a visit ? No work , just social . Lemon bars under the gazebo ? <p> RTR12 - Oh , the updates will keep coming like clockwork . In my opinion , the most interesting stuff is still coming . That would be the computer controls . It is becoming more obvious that the dispatcher 's panel is the key to the operation because it will allow one person to direct all mainline traffic . It looks like it will be very difficult to have any serious operations until that is in place . <p> This never ceases to amaze , and the stick drawings go a long way towards clearly illustrating the immense undertaking at hand . I can certainly understand where a computer and cameras would be necessary when a single operator is desired .... there 's only so much of the layout that can be viewed at any one time without aids . Just contemplating the enormous amount of wiring involved boggles the mind . Betcha wish Tesla had discovered a way of transmitting power wirelessly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for visiting the Twin Cities , just to see your layout in operation . If only arriving there on the morning Hi were possible , I 'd die a happy man . <p> RTR12 - Oh , the updates will keep coming like clockwork .

It is becoming more obvious that the dispatcher 's panel is the key to the operation because it will allow one person to direct all mainline traffic . It looks like it will be very difficult to have any serious operations until that is in place . <p> That sounds great , and the wiring and controls are my favorite part ! ! Learning more about operation , dispatching , main line control , etc . I know very little about and that will be interesting as well . Looking forward to it all and the more details the better ! ! <p> Bruce - Like I said , there are another eleven of those stick drawings that I did n't originally post . Here are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RTR12 - I have all the hardware for C/MRI and much of it is in place . I still have to connect all the panels together with a serial line , and get 110V to the power supplies to run it . Then I need to draw the dispatcher 's panel using JMRI Panel Pro . After that the individual bit controls have to be linked to the panel devices . Those cards we finished last month are the last piece of the system , and the C/MRI bits will control them . <p> George - Those were drawn with MS Paint . <p> Mark - Thanks , it 's not a real stretch for her to place the components on the cards . She did it for a living for a couple years . 175852 @qwx375852 <p> Elliot , once again , WOW ! The size of your layout and the organization you show in your approach , is amazing . Lots of progress and slowly but surely you approach your goal .

@@36015156 @5015156/ <h> Mixing Tubular Track , 0 and 0-27 ... Photos ? <p> I 've started an expansion of my layout . Seeing I 'll need 0-31 curves , I 'll have to incorporate some of the Lionel black tie O Guage tubular into my existing 0-27 profile layout . Does anyone have any photos of the two used on one layout ballasted so I can get a good idea of the look ? The idea of replacing all the track that I need to ( no sidings , tunnel , etc ) has crossed my mind but if the two look somewhat decent ballasted and in place together , I 'll live with it . <p> Search around , there are other curve sizes with the O-27 profile . I use O-31 , O42 and O-54 . I do n't recall the prices for them . They have black ties and got them from ebay . I think the seller was Horizon Hobbies or something like that . They sometimes provided free shipping . <p> Thanks Frank for actually answering my question , which was not about different curve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one layout . <p> I will be using black tie O Gauge throughout the new track work , not mixing the two like originally planned . I will not change the switches ( Ross ) nor sidings or very hard to get to areas that one ca n't really see anyway such as in the tunnels , etc . My only decision is to leave about a 3 foot long section of 0-27 style track and mate the O Gauge up to it or replace the 3 feet of 0-27 track . The 0-27 is fully ballasted with grade crossings in place so pulling it up is n't going to be very easy . <p> I 've had good luck mating O27 to O31 by just pounding the pin from the O31 into the O27 , then forming the rail around it . You also have to shim up the O27 track to bring it level with the rails of the O31 . Of course , this assumes you 're starting with bare track , having it all ballasted makes this a bit more complicated . There is an O27 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem to find the reference to it now . I guess if you arranged the approach to the O27 section with the O31 track to drop down to meet the O27 you might get away with that option . <p> I was just down stairs poking around a little . I have some older but still in good shape black tie O Gauge track I used as a temporary mock up to get an idea . I also had some ballast and where the track joins , I ballasted it to see what it would look like . I do n't think it will look to bad once it is all ballasted and worked in . While it will be noticeable to a degree , I 'm going to go all out to make it blend in . I should stress that this is in the far rear corner of the layout , a not very accessible but somewhat visible area . If it was right up front , I 'd probably go the extra mile and do it all over . I 've lowered very slightly the actual transition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a transition . It will be perfectly level . All new track will go in place between the 0-27/O transition and the re-joining to the original main , where the transition will occur at a Ross switch and I 'm sure as heck not pulling that up and moving it . <p> My original plan or thought , which I guess I did n't do so great of a job describing was using black ties 0-31 for the curves and brown 0-27 for straight all along the new track . I have opted against that . <p> All I can say is to give it a closer look . I think Frank reads too much in my statement that I had " good luck " doing that . I saw no issues with derailing , and shimming the O27 up to the O31 height did n't look bad at all . If it 's all ballasted , I suspect it 'll look even closer matched . <p> One thing to do is a trial run in a sample loop connecting the two together and see how you like it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Because wider radius curves over 0-31 will not fit in the spaceas I have attempted to explain a few times already . <p> First , I apologize for getting the discussion started off on the wrong foot . It was an honest attempt to suggest an alternative solution to your problem . Marx O34 is only about an inch bigger in actual diameter than Lionel O31 ( Marx and Lionel measure the track diameters differently ) , so I thought it might work for your situation . I do understand that is n't the route you want to take - you wanted ideas on blending the two different track types - and I believe you have received some good tips on how to do so . It sounds like you have a workable plan figured out for your layout . <p> I have a couple of places on my layout where I have had to match up different track types and rail profiles , and since I do n't ballast my track , it is a bit noticeable ... mainly due to the shims under the O27 ties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I suspect that with careful shimming and ballasting , your transitions wo n't ever be noticed by the casual observer , and they will work just fine . <p> I 'm building a layout using O27 track . I wanted to use wider radius than 27 " for my inner loop , but did not even consider using O31 because it would look terrible connected to the smaller O27 track . Marx O34 will mate up to O27 perfectly , as will other wider radius O27 track . My suggestion is to use either all O or all O27 for the smoothest running and best looking layout . <p> My layout back in the 1980 's had some areas of mixed O and O-27 . Here 's three photos I found of the station area where I had 0-27 uncoupler tracks of two types mixed in with O. It is easy to open the 0-27 to take the O-pins ( I used an awl ) , you just have to be careful to elevate the O-27 to O height . 175854 @qwx375854 175853 @qwx375853 <h> Block 175862 @qwx375862

@@36015164 @5015164/ <p> Since I 'm no Electrical Engineer , I have my 10 amp " fast blow " automotive fuses hooked up on the out-puts of each TIU channel ( which may not be correct ) . I have had many shorts and occasions when the fuse has blown with a noticeable " pop " , and have never had any issues with the TIU channels . <p> I power all 4 terminals of the TIU , and use auto fuses between the transformers and TIU . Though I seldom blow a fuse , this set-up has worked well for me . I know some people recommend more exotic fuses but these work OK . I like to change out the fuses depending on how many amps the particular locomotive/car combination draw on the track at the time . So sometimes a 7.5 amp , while other times 3 amps is plenty . With auto fuses this is simple to do . <p> I also run a TVS between the transformers and TIU on each of the 4 channels . 175854 @qwx375854 175853 @qwx375853 <h> Block 175862 @qwx375862

First I have no track plan to go by so I 've been winging it so far . I hope my pictures show up as I 'm going to refer to them to explain . The outside circle and sections coming off are all wired as one section with about 5 different power feeds , the area by the passenger terminal I figure to block on both sides of the switches including the sections coming off at both ends . When blocking these off I insulate the center rail at 4 places . When I add the power to that section and others that will require there own power do I need to add a wire to the common ? ? or not ? ? I have SPDT switches ( K103 ) from Led-Switch I have Terminal blocks on the way . I hope I 'm not confusing .. lol <p> Give me a call at Atlas 908-687-0880 ext 7142 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remotely and if I miss a call leave a message and a good reach telephone number and I will get back to you including weekends . <p> It appears you have switches ( K103 ) with 3 positions . If I understand what you 're trying to do here 's my suggestion . Connect the outer rails throughout . <p> The K103 switch then applies center-rail voltage to a controlled block to turn it on . <p> With K103 in the center position , no voltage is applied to the controlled block . <p> If one K103 controls one block , then it would be as shown on left . <p> If one K103 controls two blocks , then it would be as shown on right . Obviously , in this case , the K103 can only apply voltage is one block or the other .... not sure of a scenario where you 'd want this restriction though . <p> 1 . If you want to turn power on /off to a block you want SPST toggle switches not SPDT . <p> 2 . The SPST toggle switch is only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ switch so there are two posts only . <p> 3 . Only the center rail ( power ) is isolated in the blocks so each block gets its own power feeds . Option - You wire power to the SPST then one wire to a terminal board then fan out wires to various locations on that particular block . <p> 4 . Ground is the same for all track ( common to all track ) . Make sure metal joiners are used everywhere on both outside rails and connect ground wires where appropriate . Only exception is if you want to operate an accessory off track voltage then you want an isolated section of one outside rail . The wheel sets on the trucks complete the circuit and operate the accessory . <p> Assuming the SPDT are on-off-on and not momentary on you could make the SPDT switches work for simple on/off . Just connect two posts - one end and the middle and see what happens . If wired correctly flipping the toggle one direction turns on power . Middle position turns off power and opposite position does nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ block but then you will only be able to turn on power to one block on at a time ( not both ) . <p> Joe <p> The switches bottom left are SPST on-off for track power .

@@36015183 @5015183/ <h> Is Proto-Sound 3.0 Worth the Extra $$$ ? <p> I need to buy a new Standard Gauge Ives steam locomotive and have the option of buying a Proto-Sound 2.0 or a Proto-Sound 3.0 engine . I have no experience with Proto-Sound 3.0 and that version would cost me between $100-$200 more than the Proto-Sound 2 version . I am wondering if 3.0 is worth the extra $$$ . Your thoughts and recommedations on 2.0 vs. 3.0 would be appreciated . <p> The biggest advantage of 3.0 is that it has no battery . This is trivial if you are running the unit often , but if the unit is stored long enough for the battery to run down , it can be a nuisance to have to charge it up when you take it out of storage . Sound quality is a bit better in 3.0 , but the volume is weak on some models . Operationally , there is n't much difference . <p> There are two versions of 2.0 - one with a 9-volt battery and one with a 3-volt battery pack . The version with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the internal voltage of the motherboard ) is obsolete and no replacement boards are available if the motherboard goes out . MTH does have a kit to upgrade to the later 3v board , but it 's expensive . Replacement boards can be found on the secondary market , and there 's at least one repairman ( GGG ) who is active on the main OGR board who can sometimes fix a 5v board . Any NIB PS/2 unit with a 9v battery is getting old and probably needs the battery replaced - either with a new NIMH cell or a BCR . Do n't bother with a NiCd battery unless you have a stack of them lying around . A 3v battery pack should be OK and not need replacing . <p> Personally , I 'd spend $100 for PS/3 over PS/2 . Not sure I 'd go 200 . I 'd be more inclined to spend the extra if the PS/2 in question was the older 5v version . You can the difference by looking at the charger port on the bottom of the tender . The newer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unit with the 9v battery has a concentric connection . <p> NO ! I have Proto2 and 3 locomotives and the only advantage is no batteries . The sound is not improved and all the other options are the same as PS-2 . In a proto-3 you get a LED headlight that has Rule 17 lighting affect . Big deal . I would say save your money and get the PS-2 version . <p> I do n't have any standard gauge engines , but I do have two " O " scale trains with proto 3.0 . The sound is good , but I personally think it 's a bit cheesy . I typically keep the sound off . I wish I had gotten the traditional engines instead . Also , I have a Lionel Corporation/MTH 260e engine with proto 3.0 . I am not really a fan of the way they designed the coupler . It has an electronic port built into the coupler itself . I am really concerned that this will someday break and the engine will no longer operate . The other issue I have is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attached to the tender . I wish I had purchased the the traditional engine because I am not really interested in the sound ( it 's kind of a novelty for me personally ) , and I feel that I would have avoided future potential problems with the proto system by not having it in the first place . <p> I have 23 PS2 and 2 PS3 . I think the former are a bit more stable . When the batteries go bad , which is over 8 years if used regularly , it can be replaced with a supercapacitor or a " BCR , " which is a trade name for a supercapacitor with zener diodes to assure even cap charging . 15 of my PS2 's now have no batteries . <p> DEFINITELY do NOT purchase the P-2 version of the Brute ! Changing the P-2 battery is a bear on this engine , as it involves significant dissassembly of the three sections of the engine to get to the battery , also increasing the probability of scratching the painted surfaces ! <p> If it 's tinplate then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light bulbs . I 've got a PS3 tinplate Christmas train and the LEDs look odd . I 'd be much happier with the bulbs , now I am more than qualified to make the change but I wo n't because it 's pretty low on my list of train mod priorities <p> First off , it should be a very rare occasion to have an LED fail without something bigger failing . If it happens , garden variety LED 's will work fine . You just have to find them in the right size and color temperature . I know several people that have already replaced the bright white LED 's on some PS/3 steamers with warm-white . <p> Thanks . I am more concerned about breaking one . They stick way out on some of the Std Gauge steamers and I could see them getting broken . <p> Steve <p> Originally Posted by gunrunnerjohn : <p> First off , it should be a very rare occasion to have an LED fail without something bigger failing .

I know several people that have already replaced the bright white LED 's on some PS/3 steamers with warm-white . <p> I do n't know about others , but for me the LED headlights look a lot more like real headlights than the original anemic PS/2 bulbs . I 've used warm white and even yellow LED 's to replace the bulbs , and I get a much more focused beam that looks great , especially on a darkened layout . <p> I will say that many times I 'll use small incandescent bulbs for number boards as they need a wider light angle to look good in most cases . I also use incandescent bulbs for cab lights for the same reason . Also , I do n't want them to be as bright as headlights , I like a more subdued light level for those applications . <p> As far as lighting passenger cars , they 're seem so vastly superior over incandescent lighting that it 's hard to imagine too many arguing against that option . Even the manufacturers are picking up on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anemic . We got it you love LEDs , but other do n't , and frankly I disagree that PS-2 bulbs are anemic . <p> It is easy to put in LEDs if you want , but seems a waste in areas such as number boards , firebox glow , and cab interior . <p> Probably part of the reason the PS-3 kits stuck with bulbs . Plus no matter which ones they put in , someone would complain about warm white , golden , or white is better . This way you get to chose what you want and how bright you light it via your resistor selection . G <p> For the firebox glow , I like a few of the flickering LED bulbs behind the firebox bezel , looks a ton better than just a red light . <p> If you 'll note , I specifically mentioned that I use incandescent bulbs in number boards and cab interior for their specific characteristics . I 'm not totally against them , I just use them where I feel their characteristics make them the best fit . 175854 @qwx375854 175853 @qwx375853 <h> Block 175862 @qwx375862

Because the strands are thinner , they can be twisted down into what appears to be a smaller bundle than the electrical wire . <p> But the electrical cross-section of the more numerous , and thinner , strands in 14GA speaker wire is the same as the smaller number of thicker strands in the 14GA general purpose wire . So electrically they are the same . But you may notice the price of ' speaker wire ' is a bit higher . <p> Just looking at #14 wire in the handbook I find there are 23 different wires sold as #14 . The ones I am most fimilar with are solid #14 which is 0.0641 " in diameter and has a circular area in inches of 4109 mils. #14 wire with Class B stranding is known as 7/22 , which means is has 7 strands of #22 wire . #22 wire is 0.0253 " in diameter . #14 class B stranded wire has a circular area of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as 19/27 , which means it has 19 strands of # 27 wire . #27 wire is 0.0142 " in diameter . #14 class C stranded wire has a circular area of 3830.4 mils. #14 wire with class D stranding is known as 37/30 , which means it has 37 strands of #30 wire . #30 wire is 0.0100 " in diameter . #14 class D stranded wire has a circular area of 3700 mils . And it goes on . <p> Somerimes different applications need different stranding . For building model trains it is just a personal preference of how stiff of a wire you want to work with . You can see that there is very little difference in the circular area , so all the wires have approximately the current carrying capacity and resistance . There are cases where some foreign made wires do skimp of the copper . If you feel that the wire you got is under size just strip back some insulation , spread the strands so you can count them , and measure one strand with a micrometer . It should match one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coding has to do with type of insulation and use . TW , THW , THWN , THHN are common construction use codes on single strand wire . Example : Damp location , Direct burial , Higher heat rating , etc . You also might note that 14 gauge solid is a slightly smaller diameter than 14 gauge stranded . Also note that in most cases you are looking for Copper or Cu . There is Aluminum wire and different variations of Aluminum , example : copper clad aluminum , and you also may find Tin clad copper . <p> Whether it makes any difference or not to us , where we supply low currents to our layouts , the currents travel on the outside of the wire . The copper in the middle of wire strand caries less current than the outside edges . So if you use stranded wire , in theory you can carry more current than a solid single wire of the same cross sectional area of copper . <p> When in high school some 50+ years ago I saw a piece of the transmission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the dam to Los Angeles . It was made up of solid interlocking copper bars arrange in a circle so as to form a tube . This gave them maximum current transmission capabilities and minimum weight , important when stringing wire from tower to tower . <p> The point for this post ? Stranded wire of the same cross sectional area carries more current than a single strand wire . It will be larger in diameter than a insulated single strand wire as well because of the tiny air gaps between the individual strands . Does it all make any difference to us model railroaders ? ... Probably not because of our low current level . But it is interesting to know , it seems to me . <p> The main difference between stranded ' speaker ' wire and stranded ' general purpose ' wire is the speaker wire generally has thicker , softer , insulation , and there are more and thinner wire strands .

So if you use stranded wire , in theory you can carry more current than a solid single wire of the same cross sectional area of copper . <p> This post refers to something called the " skin effect " . The skin effect is proportional to the frequency of the alternating current . At 60 hertz ( normal USA house current ) the skin effect in negligible . Even if it was significant , standard stranded wire would do nothing to counter it . There is special wire , called " Litz wire " that has each strand insulated to counter the skin effect . The strands are also woven in specific patterns . <p> I am certain there are folks with much deeper knowledge who can expand on what I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have the benefit of it being a paired wire which simplifies pulling the wire . It should also have covering that is more flexible than those with higher fire code standards . <p> It will work just fine and provide a sufficient safety factor . David and Mike CT have provided enough detail . <p> Hey , I 'm no expert in the electrical differences and or benefits of any wire but here 's what I learned while buying the wire to power my layout . I choose speaker wire , the reason really does n't matter for the purposes of my post since I 'm only addressing the OP photo/question about size difference and pliability . <p> First , not all 14AWG wire is the same in that there actually is something called " true 14 AWG " wire versus what I 'll call " nomimal 14 AWG " wire . Yes , you guessed it , while some wire may be labeled and sold as 14 AWG the actual copper core may not be a full 14 gauge and therefore narrower or thinner as in the photo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ build our benchwork . A 2 " x4 " is not actually 2 " x4 " and therefore it is called nominal lumber versus true stock . <p> Next , not all stranded wire contains the same number of strands of copper wire inside the casing . This is true for both " true " gauge and " nominal " . What 's the difference ? As I understand it and it was explained to me , the more strands the better the conductivity . Is this true ? I do n't know but that how an expert I know explained it to me . What role does the number of strands play besides conductivity in what we do ? Well , I can tell you that the speaker wire I initially purchased from HD was true 14AWG but it contained only 7 strands of copper wire inside while the " true 14 AWG " theater wire I purchased afterwards contains 105 strands . The theater is much more pliable than the 7 stranded wire . <p> My smallish ( 7x9 ) layout is wired in the MTH recommended STAR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ points on the track . Each run is two automotive wires twisted together and terminated at a common point on a terminal board . The results is the MTH DCS signal strength is virtually 10 around the whole of the layout . The track ( unfortunately ) is MTH RealTrax and there are NO soldered track sections interconnections . I avoided using speaker wire and simply twisted a pair of 16 gauge automotive wires for the length of the run ( easy to do with a bench vise to hold the ends of the two wires and an electric drill at the other end , run until the desired amount of twist appears ) . This makes the wiring much neater under the layout if you plan support points along the wire paths . If you expect many more than three or four engines running on any one block at a time you may want to increase the wire gauge to 14 or even 12 gauge ( ? ? ) . Automotive wire as you might get at NAPA is truly the gauge marked on the spool , in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not all 14AWG wire is the same in that there actually is something called " true 14 AWG " wire versus what I 'll call " nomimal 14 AWG " wire . Yes , you guessed it , while some wire may be labeled and sold as 14 AWG the actual copper core may not be a full 14 gauge and therefore narrower or thinner as in the photo . <p> Never heard about this . Is there any place I can read about it ? <p> Next , not all stranded wire contains the same number of strands of copper wire inside the casing . This is true for both " true " gauge and " nominal " . What 's the difference ? As I understand it and it was explained to me , the more strands the better the conductivity . Is this true ? <p> As far as I know : The more strands , the more flexible and expensive the wire will be . The type of insulation also has an impact on flexibility ( at least for the wire sizes I use ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ See my comment above about skin effect and Litz wire . <p> The real test would be to measure the resistance . Not really practical for most though . 14 AWG should measure 2.5 ohms per 1000 feet . Pretty small for even a good digital ohmmeter to get right . 100 feet would be .25 ohms but you would need a Wheatstone bridge . Likely not many here have one of those . <p> Like CW I have never heard of true AWG . Is that like " music power " they used to rate audio amps in the old days ? <p> The real test would be to measure the resistance . Not really practical for most though . 14 AWG should measure 2.5 ohms per 1000 feet . Pretty small for even a good digital ohmmeter to get right . 100 feet would be .25 ohms but you would need a Wheatstone bridge . Likely not many here have one of those . <p> I have a Leeds &amp; Northrup Type " S " meter that is based on a Wheatstone bridge . According to the material @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measure the resistance of a shorted line to determine how far away the short was occurring . Imagine that ! <p> The easy way to measure the resistance is using power . If you have 100 feet of that wire , run 10A through it and measure the voltage drop . 10A through 100 feet of #14 would be about 2.5 volts of drop . That 's for one way , for a 100 foot pair , it 's 5V , that 's 200 feet of wire . <p> true , there are different wire gauge standards ( SWG , BWB , AWG ) , but American Wire Gauge ( AWG ) is defined by the National Bureau of Standards so i find it hard to believe there is a " true " AWG , " nominal " AWG or any other acceptable non-standard . AWG is defined by the cross sectional area of the conductor or combined conductors as a logarithmic scale , so as with a 3dB change in audio volume , a difference of 3 in wire gauge doubles of halves the current carrying capacity ( ie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which has twice the capacity of 17G wire ) . <p> a number of things may make similar American Wire Gauges appear different as in the number of conductors or thickness of insulation , but there should be no difference in current handling capacity . <p> I am totally out of my league here but I recently took a layout apart and took the 100 pounds of insulated stranded wire to to a scrap dealer and was surprised that insulated solid copper wire ( like Romex ) was worth $1.00 per pound but stranded insulated copper wire only bought 50 cents a pound . When I asked about the disparity , I was informed that there was less wire content in the stranded . I did not know how to argue so I just took what they gave me and went back home . <p> Whether it makes any difference or not to us , where we supply low currents to our layouts , the currents travel on the outside of the wire . The copper in the middle of wire strand caries less current than the outside edges . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can carry more current than a solid single wire of the same cross sectional area of copper . <p> This post refers to something called the " skin effect " .

The strands are also woven in specific patterns . <p> I am certain there are folks with much deeper knowledge who can expand on what I 've written . <p> Yes you pretty much have it all said on skin effect . The current in the wire tends to go to the outside circumference of the cross section of the wire , minimizing the number of field lines encircling the current producing the field . <p> I worked with a lot of Litz wire in grad school winding 455 KHz IF transformers for an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is negligible at 60 Hz , it 's also true that the benefits of Litz wire are negligible higher than a frequency of about 1 MHz . By the way , I stripped the enamel off the 40 or so hairlike strands of Litz wire by heating the wire end red hot with a Bunsen burner and then dipping it in alcohol . The enamel just popped off . Might work for any enamel wire , but I have never tried it for solid enamel covered wire . The alcohol catches fire frequently , but is extinguished easily by dropping a lid on the alcohol . <p> Memories <p> As to the original post , again keep in mind that a lot of the " audio " wire on the Internet is actually copper clad aluminum . In that case , AWG 14 is approximately AWG16 in terms of current carrying capacity per a desired minimum voltage drop for a specified length of wire . IE , it 's more resistive . Also keep in mind that the recommended AWG in wire tables for 100 foot runs of house wire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because an allowable voltage drop of say 5 VAC for a 120 VAC circuit , while acceptable in house wiring is way too much for a low voltage , 18 VAC , circuit . So GRJ 's method of measuring the voltage drop with the current you are intending to run thru the wire is preferred when sizing your layout wire . <p> As yours is a DCS installation , you may be powering it with a Z-4000 . If so , and you expect high current draws like 10A ( such as superimposed TMCC for a older twin Pulmor loco ) , you might consider that your source will have an adverse form factor , which might be 1.35 or so . This means that the heating in your wiring will be greater by this factor ; from this you can recalculate your expected voltage drops . This increased heating would indicate replacing #14 wire with #11 wire , thus #12 or #10 wire could be a better choice . <p> I had a chance to make test readings on a large club layout , which had its bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ #16 wire pairs went ) from two Z-4000 's set at 18v . The summer layout temperatures were about 40-50C ( 104F ) . A single unit TMCC loco as above stalled with a train of one passenger car , at the approximate most remote point about 130 feet plus some feet ( 10 ? ) of Real Track . <p> My comments are based on this , plus some research on the sparse reports from the early 90 's web . One report discussed the form factor that a 5-tooth " comb " ( variable pulse width in a half-cycle wave ) would produce in varying the effective voltage of a constant sine wave input . I was also informed that the Z4 contained a fixed 28v output transformer for the handle outputs . ( The patent omits many details , but cites the " comb " . ) <p> I realize I will have stepped on the toes of some who may believe that a waveform , whose envelope is a pure sine wave , is always also a pure sine wave . Unfortunately , this is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wire numbers , not 3 as mentioned above , to double the current capacity of a wire ( when heating controls , as is the usual case with wires #10 to #14 ) . This is because the surface area of the wire does not increase at the same rate as the cross-section area increases . The heat dissipation is limited by the surface area . This rule of 4x ( #16&gt;#12 , for example ) is not as close if the insulation thickness changes ( such as #22 compared to #14 , due to the difference in usual voltage classes , or if a high temperature wire is used ) . The 4-step doubling factors are x 1.19 ; 1.41 ; 1.68 ; 2.00 . Or , in the commonly available wire sizes , 1.41 ; 2.00 ; and going down , 0.71 and 0.50 ( thus if 10A for #16 , then 7A for #18 and 5A for #20--with 60C insulation ) . With 10A current limiting and high temperature wire UL has permitted #18 in affixed output wiring of certain Toy Transformers <p> I realize I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a waveform , whose envelope is a pure sine wave , is always also a pure sine wave . Unfortunately , this is not true . Sorry <p> --Frank <p> Great comment . There are many recent issues with increased heating due to switching supply loads and non sine wave forms in power distribution systems . This has become a major issue with large office buildings forcing some serious rethinking on wire size per current load . <p> Harmonics would be at a higher frequency , and thus experience more impedance . More impedance , more heating and energy dissipated . I 've never considered that for low frequency power transmission , interesting ... <p> I listened to EZMIKE and bought the best 14 AWG stranded wire I could find after reading about wire testing . I bought my wire ( which just arrived 10 minutes ago . . . . YIPPEE , from Monoprice . On the New Munoz Lines , there will be no compromise . Freight or passenger , it will all get there on time . Right , Mike ? <p> Harmonics would be at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ More impedance , more heating and energy dissipated . I 've never considered that for low frequency power transmission , interesting ... <p> There are a zillion effects that occur when frequencies get high in relation to the dimensions of the conductor . Despite our best efforts to make an issue out of them , they are ALL negligible in toy train wiring ! <p> Probably so , but interesting never the less . Again the JRG method , wire the AWG run , run the current you think you need , measure the voltage drop and if it is satisfactory , drive a nail in it ... <p> I am totally out of my league here but I recently took a layout apart and took the 100 pounds of insulated stranded wire to to a scrap dealer and was surprised that insulated solid copper wire ( like Romex ) was worth $1.00 per pound but stranded insulated copper wire only bought 50 cents a pound . When I asked about the disparity , I was informed that there was less wire content in the stranded . I did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave me and went back home . <p> That sounds suspicious for a couple of reasons . First , less copper should equal less weight , which should cover any price difference , and second , a 50% price difference should mean a similar reduction in the amount of copper , which should be easy to see the difference with the naked eye . Are you sure they were n't talking about multi-conductor wire ( like telephone wire ) , which would have a much higher ratio of insulation material to copper for the same weight ? <p> DCS wants feed points ( Lock-ons ) fed in a star pattern from the transformer . That means paris of wire to each lock-on . When twisted together it takes half the time to string wire laying on your back and crawling around under the train table . Also there is a electrical benefit . <p> Twisted pair wires act to cancel out any spurious signals from the track or induced along the travel path . They are less susceptible to spurious interference signals . <p> I also find it much neater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have used this technique for years when I would rewire vintage motorcycles by providing every circuit with its own return path in a twisted pair , augmenting the frame ground path . <p> Some replies ... sorry to be a bit late getting back , it 's been a hard week . <p> @Overland Flyer-- Gary , thanks for the area data . I do n't know about #11 , but curiously #9 is used in a lot of control systems which run some distance outside . Usually buried , in a variety of cabled configurations , or singly in conduit ... I never learned exactly why #9 , but just followed what I had observed . Actually , you can get anything you want , almost , if you buy enough of it . I needed a #9 but with a low-cap insulation , which was a special order ... I 've forgotten if the minimum was 7000 feet or 11,000 , but I needed 17,000 feet . <p> @PLCProf-- Basically , harmonics are dealt with mathematically by decomposing the unusual wave form into its Fourier series , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ series of sine and cosine waves , and it has been proven that any waveform can be so represented . Actually doing that is another matter , and having been required to do some of the simpler cases in the days before computers and canned programs , I can say there is little point in learning how these days . But square waves generally as a practical matter have their corners rounded by the odd harmonics-- 3rd , 5th , 7th and so on , of increasing frequencies and decreasing amplitude . So the 3rd is most important , and the total added loss is pegged at being enough to cancel the advantage of reduced neutral size in multi-phase circuits feeding fluorescent lights . Typically such things are determined by using two watt-meters , at each end of the circuit conductors , which measure energy and thus heat . Thus , I suppose , form factors as an expression of the added heating effect . This , despite the effect on all ( including model train ) motors being one of voltage reduction , which is quite serious . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drop , at the time , and inferred a form factor around 1/3 added , from that . Much later , I found on the internet an example of a pulse width modified device which produced a reduced effective voltage , using a process similar to the Z4000 . Possibly this was a dimmer design ; it was about 1992 with a form factor stated to be about 1.35 ( 35 percent ) . This was similar to my voltage drop problem . A first problem with such a system is that the fundamental of the output is not 60 cycles , but n x 60 , n being the number of square-edged comb teeth in a cycle . This is thus the common 400-cycle system problem on steroids . <p> ! wanted to add a bit about the DCS signal and twisted wiring , and how the form factor problem was dealt with in the passing years , but it is again late . Later . --Frank <p> Some replies ... sorry to be a bit late getting back , it 's been a hard week . <p> @Overland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know about #11 , but curiously #9 is used in a lot of control systems which run some distance outside .

If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AWG wire they should be reported to the NEC or National Electric Code . <p> I have never heard of nominal wire or what ever . Speaker wire labeling is just another way to get more money out of the buyer . <p> Lee Fritz 175859 @qwx375859 <p> My understanding of speaker wiring is that an 8-ohm speaker , say , is actually wound as 7-ohms . Then the wiring from the amplifier to speaker out and back would be sized to make up the missing 1-ohm . This of course depends on how far the speakers are from the amplifier . <p> In this case , the internal resistance of the amplifier , as a signal source , would be 8-ohms in each channel , and you would connect " 8=ohm " speakers . But what is at work here is that the maximum power output from a source occurs when the resistance of the external circuit is exactly the same as the source resistance . This is a proven mathematical relationship . So you choose a wire size that gives a half-ohm each way . In a resistive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is the current through the speaker coil which drives the sound output . Bigger speaker wire is not necessarily bigger sound . <p> Doubtless there is some inductive impedance effect as well . As long as this is relatively rather smaller than the resistive effect , the result will be a phase shift but little effect on output . ( The ears deal well with phase shift , even if different at the two speakers . ) <p> This maximum power output relationship can be used to investigate situations where external thermal breakers are used to protect circuits use on layouts . To shorten a lot of explanation , just consider most such devices were developed to protect wire large enough that the voltage drop at the end of such circuits would not exceed 5% . With smaller or less conductive wire , there is risk of not drawing enough current to have breakers open with sufficient speed . Another risk with speaker wire is that its insulation may not alway be rated for 60-degree Centigrade operation , another assumption with these breakers . <p> At one time I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that solid wire delivered more power than stranded over distance and my school was wrong . I never asked if that was voltage or amperage , measured cross section equal , or written rating , I just followed orders then unfortunately . <p> On the other side of the coin , stranded wire normally gives a larger contact surface at connections by flattening out . To stand the coin on edge , more pressure yeilds a better connection , it 's a direct relation , more pressure = less resistance , and a fat wire can withstand more pressure . <p> Being a fan of overkill and lacking my own lab , for power I just go big , and sleep well ... or better anyhow . Fat wire just does n't glow red with heat as easy , plain and simple . <p> Lionel 's use of solid wire in sets ? I figure it was for ease of use with the lock on sprung clip connectors ( 50 years of trains and I can never remember the real name for those clips , lol , even an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only remember it begins with an F and sounds German to me ....... and that 's progress , lol . ) <p> I have read that in use on sound systems , that stranded was prefered to maintain the frequencies more accurately and too large a wire can cause a big loss in delivering highs . There are audiophile guidelines based on type , length , wattage , and frequencies . Check the strand count on audiophile wire , it 's usually a huge count . I NEED 12 gauge on my sound equipment , but it 's overkill on the layout .. <p> All things considered , on a command system , I 'd use slightly oversized stranded for signal retention unless the mfg. specified otherwise . <p> This is a very interesting thread ; Time domain reflectometers , Litz wire , harmonics ... Wait , is this model trains or radio school ? lol Heck , I 've been using twisted pairs to feed my layouts for 20+ year but never considered it for anything except convenience . <p> I am going to throw my experience in here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ main line loop as at least 2 power feeds ( most have 3 or more ) . I never rely on a switch or crossing to carry track power . All feed pairs are twisted for convenience . <p> I use a decent quality 14 gauge wire ( something with a decent number of strands ) from all power sources ( transformers , power bricks , etc ) to what I term distribution ( a TIU or terminal block ) . <p> From distribution , I use the same sort of decent 16 gauge wire to feed the tracks . Remember the rule of thumb is 2 feeds minimum for each mainline loop . Why only 16 gauge ? Well , another rule of thumb I learned years ago is 2 - 16 gauge wires can carry the equivalent of what 1 - 14 gauge wire can . 2 - 14 's can carry what a 12 gauge wire can and so on . So by using at least 2 16 gauge feeders , I spread the distribution without having to use the size of a 14 gauge wire . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 8 ' of track or so . With this in mind , even a 4x8 would have 3 feeds . <p> When I build a layout I test it in 2 ways . First I run a conventional engine around to check how well it maintains speed . Then I add a set of passenger cars with incandescent lights and repeat the test . If the speed is good , you know you have the feed placement and number of feeds correct.The second test is a DCS signal test . <p> Last year I built a new holiday display using my madness . My DCS signal was no less than 10 all the way around and my old 671rr pulling a load of MTH passenger cars ran as consistent as something can without speed control . <p> This is how I do it . It works . But there would be nothing wrong with using larger wire around an entire layout . I would n't use solid wire for 2 reasons : it 's a bear to work with compared to flexible stranded wire and I am not sure how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussions regarding higher frequency ) . <p> One last thing I will say is if I were lucky enough to be able to build a large layout , I would consider using 12 gauge wire for long distribution runs ( 50 ' ) . Not for any other reason than 12 gauge wire has less loss than 14 gauge for the longer runs . <p> I hope my $.02 helps and does n't confuse the conversation . <p> Tony 175852 @qwx375852 <p> I am totally out of my league here but I recently took a layout apart and took the 100 pounds of insulated stranded wire to to a scrap dealer and was surprised that insulated solid copper wire ( like Romex ) was worth $1.00 per pound but stranded insulated copper wire only bought 50 cents a pound .

Because there are also small gaps between the strands , a stranded wire will always have a slightly larger overall diameter than a solid wire with the same AWG . " <p> But then of course , the amp/distance rating depends also on the material . Copper , copper clad aluminum , etc . And AWG tables only deal with wire cross section , not material ... although there may be tables for different wire materials . I think there are tables for aluminum wire , but copper clad I have n't seen . Also there is copper clad aluminum in different percentages like 10% cu and 15% cu over aluminum . <p> I am totally out of my league here but I recently took a layout apart and took the 100 pounds of insulated stranded wire to to a scrap dealer and was surprised that insulated solid copper wire ( like Romex ) was worth $1.00 per pound but stranded insulated copper wire only bought 50 cents a pound . When I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was less wire content in the stranded . I did not know how to argue so I just took what they gave me and went back home . <p> I have sold scrap copper and wire for several years . The price you get is dependent on the company you are selling to and what their market wants . I have seen them pay $1.00 per pound for used , mangled , absolutely worthless circuit boards because they were getting $7.00/lb on a contract from China . <p> We have only two yards left locally and both owned by a very large metals corp with about 50 sites in the U.S. If you take them 16 gauge or lower stranded wire that has the insulation removed you will get the highest price . If you take them solid 99% copper bars or high end 99% solid copper computer heat sinks you will get 1/2 of the price of the 16 gauge stranded wire price . You can polish the 99% copper , cut it in half for them or what ever to show them it is solid and pure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It primarily has to do with what their current demands and contracts are . On smaller gauge wire and wire with insulation still on it , the price drops very dramatically . Computer cables are almost not worth driving to the salvage yard to sell . Their price doubles on insulated power cords 18 gauge and heavier if you want to spend the time and effort to cut the ends off of it . <p> As for the layout , I used 14 gauge solid wire around most of the layout distance . I tapped into the track with a 16 gauge stranded pigtail and soldered to the bottom of the tracks . It just happened to be what I had the most variety of in colors and with the solid wire I could pull it tight and mechanically anchor it at each end like a guitar string . That kept it from sagging down . <p> The interesting phenom in the whole transformer/speaker wire size discussion is looking at the smallest link in the whole connection . The wire size inside the big stereo amp and the driver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never looked inside the modern transformers and bricks , but I wonder what size wire is used in the power distribution getting out to the outside user interface terminals . 175854 @qwx375854 175853 @qwx375853 <h> Block 175862 @qwx375862

The rods on the 1950 are more akin to those found on the 700E , a smoother casting and a more matt gray finish while the rods on the 1964 version have poorer side rod castings a bright plate to hide it . <p> The steam chest of the 1950 retains the guides for the valve stem crosshead although Lionel did n't install the valve stem crossheads as part of the valve gear . On the 1964 version the guides are missing entirely . <p> The collector rollers on the 1950 version are wider , while the rollers used on the 1964 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " 773 " on the cab of the 1950 version is thinner , sharper and stamped in silver , while the number on the 1964 version are larger , heavier stampings and in white . <p> The motor installed on the 1950 version is better , more reliable and runs better than its 1964 counterpart . The 1964 version uses a " new design " motor , but that term is nothing more than a marketing scheme for poorly wound inferior fields and armatures . <p> Last but not least , the frame and drive assembly of the 1950 was more carefully installed and ran smoother out of the box . The 1964 version , and especially the 1966 versions were hastily assembled and most run poorly . This can be resolved , but takes a bit of work by a knowledgeable service person . <p> There are fakes of both out there , so be careful , if you 're not sure try to find one at a show and have someone you trust to point out the difrnces to you . <p> Recently I bought one and thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a ' 64 worked over to look like the ' 50 model . <p> My best tipoff has been the numbers on the cab of the loco , the ' 50 version has thicker numbers , but remember renumbering by some fakers is common . <p> The one I bought was supposed to have been recently serviced , but the armature was totally black where it should have a copper color , I serviced and lubed and oiled and now have a fair runner . Next is a total motor teardown with new bearings , when I find the time . <p> Oh yeah , the seller to me is a friend and I do n't believe he really knew the difference , so we are still train buddies . I think he can now tell them apart , thanks to seeeing my ' 50 model aside the ' 64 . <p> The 1950 version of the engine has an extension to the steam chest ( above the second axle of the pilot ) that is missing on the 1964 version . You can see the difference if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one is the 1964 version is the third link ) : <p> Thank you for the help . NOW I can see the difference ! And it makes me feel better because I just bought one from a friend , and it has the extra valve guide . But I cant compare the lettering , because at some point in its past , it was re-numbered . The story goes that the original owner in the early fifties thought that 773 was n't realistic enough , so he had it changed to 5205 and added white striping to the drive and pilot flanges , and the edge of the walkway along the boiler . Also the valve guide that i 'd 's it as the 1950 is half broken off on one side . <p> In hindsight , it was an unfortunate thing to do , but the engine is still fabulous and a great runner . The other difference is that the original owner did n't  like the tender , so he traded it for a 700t , which again is a real brick . <p> Here are some picturesI apologize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what to do with this ? Just enjoy it as is ? I plan to run it , so it wont be a shelf queen , but if I had it repainted and numbered , would that hurt the value ? Its still a 773 after all . <p> There is a fix for the latter motor&gt; Whoever made it glued the armature to the field plate and relied on it for insulation from the windings . I fixed a couple for a guy and it ran just as good as 1950 version . <p> Hi JimNo , the 700t is the real deal . I read that the Madison tenders had gold lettering and the Lionel white . This is definately white . Plus my friend says it was in the fifties when his Dad acquired this combination.John <p> I won a 1964 773 Hudson with New York Central tender earlier this year as the grand prize in the 2010 Metropolitan Train Collectors Associaiton ( METCA ) raffle , graded TCA standard C-8 with variation .

I also replaced the headlight with an LED a couple of months ago . The lighting is much better and brighter now . I know some will claim I committed sacrolige , but the old headlight even at high voltages was dim . The pullmor motor from the engine draws a lot of amps from the Z-4000 .

@@36015189 @5015189/ <p> This is a bit complicated . The basic difference between Proto 2.0 and 3.0 is that 3.0 does n't use a battery , thereby eliminating many of the complaints about previous versions of Proto-Sound . Some Proto-3 units also have better sound quality than Proto-2 , but this varies and is a matter of opinion . Some Proto-3 units do n't produce much sound volume ; others can be cranked up just as loud as Proto-2 , if your operating environment demands it . <p> There are two versions of Proto-2 . The earlier version used a 9v ( actually 8.4v ) rechargeable battery and is generally referred to as 5v Proto-2 because that is the internal voltage used on the boards . The later version uses a 3v battery pack and the internal voltage is also 3v . Replacement boards are not available for the 5v systems , but there are a couple of repair techs who can sometimes fix the early versions . You can replace the battery on either Proto-2 system with a gadget called a BCR , which is a capacitor bank that serves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as availability goes , it varies according to model .

@@36015190 @5015190/ <p> Just thought I 'd share an interesting project going on at the AGHR club here in LA with our telemetry train ( now version 2.0 ) . <p> Intro : <p> At the AGHR club in LA we 've built a stock car with an RPI3 embedded host computer and a bunch of telemetry sensors which we call the " Telemetry Train " . While some of the train 's system are focused on troubleshooting power signals , DCS , and TMCC control signals ( not the focus of this post ) , one of the other aspects is we 've been exploring is using MEMS accelerometers to measure defects and kinks in the track rails as the train rolls along . <p> To implement the motion tracking we use a raspberry Pi3 Computer ( features the Broadcom ARM BCM2837 ) powered by a small Lithium Ion Battery . We leverage the AXDL 337 motion sensor from analog devices to do the actual sensing of motion : ADXL337 and then read it 's analog outputs with a high speed delta-sigma ADC ( typically running 50-100 Hz ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is why a high resolution ADC is necessary , so we went with a nice MCP3424 from Microchip LONG ... that has about 80 dB of spur and distortion free dynamic range . The MCP also has an I2C bus so it 's very easy to interface with the Pi3 . <p> As you can see in the setup picture , we have the AXDL MEMs sensor tucked into the wheel truck of the stock so that any of the bumps we hit along the layout are captured . <p> Capture Software : <p> Software wise we just have a C script that reads the I2C bus at 60 Hz or so and writes down the X , Y and Z acceleration from each sample into a csv file . The script needs to be simple in order to support the fastest possible sample rate , so it 's not even conditional , we just have a for loop that runs for n increments and we tune n based on the layout length and sample rate . Samples are loaded into a large array of doubles , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ file ops on each loop would be too slow for 60 Hz sampling ) . <p> Back end Signal Processing : <p> Finally we drag that csv into matlab and just do a vector magnitude calculation R = sqrt ( X2+Y2+Z2 ) and do some basic linear scaling from the sensor datasheet to get the true force in Newtons . The timescale is also pretty trivial , we just scale the axis by the sample rate . <p> In general MEMs data is noisy , so we apply a smoothing function and just tune the span ( typically we use 3-5 point span ) . On one hand you want to capture the violent discontinuities , but on the other you do n't want to have to physically investigate every peak in 5 min of data sampled at 60 Hz . Additionally in matlab we wrote an . m script to auto align track data from multiple passes ( basically a maximum cross correlation vs. time shifting function ) so that we can do some basic statistics . We then adjust the confidence interval ( a given feature has to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order to be considered a real track issue ) . This dramatically cuts down on the false alarms and reduces time inspecting the track . <p> As a first test we ran the train over the same section of track twice in the lab when pulled by a locomotive at 5 SMPH . In the first pass the track was normal , while in the second pass a gap of 1mm was intentionally created to show the sensitivity of the sensor . As seen in the data the MEMs sensor captures the vibration with a large force vector magnitude as the wheel truck encounters the discontinuity , and the oscillations as the train resumes its rest position is also visible . <p> Finally we ran the telemetry train around the club layout ( takes 5 min and 29 seconds per pass ) and collected 4 sets of data over 4 passes . This data was collected at a much higher speed of 34 SMPH , ( I plan to investigate the effect of speed on the system sensitivity later on ) . Of course a large layout has vibration and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to mark those onto the captured data traces . The remaining peaks in force magnitude are then investigated physically ( time correlates to train position in the layout ) . What we do is take a photo of where the train is at 0,30s,60s , ... and use that to know what section of the layout the data corresponds to . We then evaluate kinks or other discontinuities in the rails and make repairs as necessary . <p> Overall it 's a pretty elegant way to manage a large layout . One of the next steps I want to look at is having multiple telemetry trains coordinate to reduce the acquisition time at slow speeds through large layouts . This is mostly just more DSP work to correlate end-points and stitch the data . <p> Extremely cool use of technology in our hobby . Can you put an alert strobe on top that would flash when hitting a point ( set tolerance ) out of gauge or rough ? That might help quickly identify specific locations needing inspection . <p> Hey there ! .... I actually did think about some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or even 1 of its components ) goes over a threshold . There are 2 issues though <p> 1 . We do n't do the filtering online , we are doing it after . That means the raw data would have to be used which is noisy ( since we have n't smoothed it yet ) so the light would flash a lot . <p> 2 . Loop speed <p> Right now we have a loop like the top one . If you add the conditional for a light or something else you loose loop performance pretty quickly . Some of the vibration events are like a 20th of a second ( 50ms ) so if you sample too slow you might start missing them ! <p> Another one to try would be using a webcam running a totally different software thread taking still pictures at maybe 4-5 Hz then time-stamping them . Then just link the time index in the result to the given picture with the same index . I guess you would want the webcam pointed out the back ... I need to think about that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terribly different from what is done in the real world to acquire load data for mechanical simulation testing . <p> I notice the accel is mounted in what appears to be a slight angle though . I know the ones I work work with have to be aligned with the intended measurement axis . <p> It would be cool to set up a wheel encoder to correlate distance with the recorded events . <p> Yeah wheel counter . So professionally I 'm a chip designer and generally not very mechanically-adept so the wheel counter did n't work out so well for me ( or the train ) . I hope someone better than me tries that though ! <p> Good catch on the accel angle . I mounted it the way it fits best . It creates a DC offset in the signal due to gravity when is is n't mounted normal , but since I turn it into total magnitude ( X2+Y2+Z2 ) in the end the orientation is lost in the end of the processing anyways . I thought about analyzing the track as X , Y , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case of a bump , only 1 axis is dominant anyways . <p> What a great way for troubleshooting . Have you tested this on different track types ? IE fast track , gargraves , ect ? <p> I tried it on the fast-snap-track and tube-track in my lab , and I think the club layout we ran it over has a mixture of tracks , some flex and some others . Since it 's basically detecting when the train shudders I think it wo n't matter too too much about the track structure itself . We will certainly try it though to make sure . <p> Well if you record the raw accelerations from the x , y , and z axes , you could also see things like twist and yaw by calculation . This may help catch gauge issues and other anomalies like dips and sags . Are you using a fixed mass to calculate forces then ? This is so cool man ! <p> It would be interesting to see that info compared directly to a sound wave analysis of the same run . <p> Talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Sound is an interesting thought for sure . My first instinct is the train is kind of an ambient noisy environment . Normally I 'd say we could just put an equalizer to push down that background noise , but the bumps are going to be very broadband sounds ( making them hard to filter selectively ) . Regular vibrations may cause issues , I du n no , maybe a FEM simulation would tell something . <p> I like the idea . It 's probably quicker to build than to simulate . I 'll put it on the project list for 2017 . An electret mic on the wheel truck , an audio amp ( maybe an LM386 or something similar ) . The captured data file ( I guess native wave ) is going to be big 44KHz X a 16 bit sound X 5min around the layout ... so the software needs some thinking to handle cleanly . <p> Well if you record the raw accelerations from the x , y , and z axes , you could also see things like twist and yaw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other anomalies like dips and sags . Are you using a fixed mass to calculate forces then ? This is so cool man ! <p> Yeah we measured the weight of the trucks directly and did some ansys simulations to figure out the approximate dampening factor from the car body above . <p> I think the biggest limitation is the sample rate . The 60 Hz is a bit mediocre for measuring motion but we 're constrained since it needs to like ... fit in the train . Most of the recorded bumps are only 1-2 samples long so the data is pretty sparce and it 's hard to make sense or classify signals as this or that type of issue .... <p> The issue with higher sampling is there are only two types of commerical ADCs out there : <p> 1 . Simple ADCs that you read directly from your code . These do n't have a time limit but their sample rate is really limited since it 's a for loop or something running on the computer . This can cover the time of the train on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> 2 . FiFO strobed ADCs that quickly capture a few 1000 points at high speed then return them to the computer at low speed . This has the sample rate and bandwidth to capture at KHz rates , but only for a few seconds so it ca n't even come close to covering a whole layout ( or even a 10 ft section of track ) <p> I guess we could like have the ADC stream the ACCs to an SRAM , but then there needs to be an FPGA with a memory controller and a USB controller to download them after . That 's at the high end on cost , complexity and design work ... but technical constraints aside ... if we could sample at 1 KHz or something similar so the raw accelerations were smooth functions instead of just spikes in the waveform ....

The attached photo shows about one half of the buildings I use on my Christmas layout . I have found St. Nicholas Square to be just as nice as Dept. 56 but at a much lower price . <p> . Has anyone found a practible way to keep the walls and roofs of these buildings from glowing ? I Do n't see painting them on the inside as a viable solution with their solid bases and many internal nooks and crannies impossible to get to with a brush . Likewise pouring in a liquid pant to coat walls also would n't work as how whould you keep the paint away from the window and door openings ? Also , if paint is n't uniformly applied , the walls might appear blotchy when lit from the inside . <p> Someone mentioned lighting them with leds rather than the 7 watt incadescent bulbs which come with them . Has anyone actually done that ? If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside of the buildings ? Were they bright enough to look realistic ? Maybe to many of you a glowing building is n't a distraction but rather adds ambience to your setting but for those who find glowing walls a distraction , what are some remedies ? When you mix glowing buildings side by side with buildings made by Lionel or MTH which do n't glow , what do tou think ? A distraction or adds atmosphere to the scene ? <p> I have about 40 Dept. 56 Snow Village buildings , collected over a number of years . I haven ; t really added to the collection in recent years because I 'm running out of space for just about everything and anything . I do have a number of the buildings on display in various areas of my home--mantle , bookcases , etc. , but really would like to incorporate them into a layout of some sort . <p> That last layout I had that featured those buildings was a trolley pike ( with SuperStreets ) I built last Christmas .

Being new at it I am still trying to find or refine my look . I have some Lemax and K line bldgs from another forum member , some plasticville from a flea market , some cardstock and my wife 's garge sale find of 13 buildings a mix of Dickens , Lemax , Dept 56 and some unknowns for a total of $12 !

Sometimes though , it 's neat to see the glow through the structures . <p> My former layout , which started as a seasonal Christmas pike , featured about 50 or so Dept. 56 and Stoney Express ceramic/percelain buildings in a multi-tiered semi-hi-rail/toy rail setting . Jim Barrett photographed the layout a few years ago , and although I have n't seen the pictures yet , if it has n't appeared by now , I am doubting it 'll ever appear in OGR . <p> My new layout ( island shape in center of basement ) plans call for mostly larger scale Railking buildings on the layout foreground , and concave-shape modules for the basement corners that will showcase our ceramic structures . The goal is a walk-around hi-rail layout in the middle of the basement and seasonal displays/themes in the corners with Dept. 56 Christmas in one area , Halloween in the another , and a Polar Express theme in the 3rd . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Get the Dept 56 low voltage lighting system/strip .

Going to a train show in medina Ohio tomorrow and there is a parts guys there . I figure to double the parts order because I have the rock island and the D L &amp; W ............. Paul <p> I recently did this repair and learned a couple of things . Bear with me , it takes a little explaining : <p> Not long after I saw this thread , my sister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always been noisy , but now it would sometimes stutter and refuse to move . Pushing it a short distance would help . I stuck my little finger into the space between the ends of the stationary field laminations and pushed on the armature . Bonk ! Bonk ! Sure enough , obvious play , and the source of the noise . <p> I tore the engine apart . The worm gear looked OK , so we just ordered new bearings , as shown in the repair article . And got the wrong ones . After some sleuthing , I realized that that the diagram in the article , which is the same as the diagram in the Greenberg 's guide , is in error : <p> There are two problems here . The first is that the " Front Bearing , " part number 2020M-17 , is shown on the wrong end of the motor . It should go on the gear end , which is toward the front of the engine . Not too a big deal if you are ordering both bearings . <p> The bigger mistake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This does not fit the LTI Northern . If you try to install it into the Northern , you get this : <p> That 's the 671M-20 bearing sticking out of the motor housing , with the ball bearing race ( " Thrust Bearing , " no. 681-121 , in the diagram ) between it and the armature . Below is a photo of the 671M-20 ( left ) next to the bearing which we eventually installed . A big difference ! <p> I seemed to remember hearing that the horizontal motors made prior to 1950 did not have the ball bearings contained in a race : they were loose in the motor . In the picture below , you can see that the 671M-20 is counter-bored , I presume to trap the ball bearings against the armature shaft . So it seems that this rear bearing is correct for pre-1950 engines only . <p> As you can see in the photo , the correct rear bearing is part number 681-120 . The clue to that was the number of the ball bearing race ( a.k.a . " Thrust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new parts , Lionel tended to incorporate the catalogue number of the item in which the part was first used . So the race was new in 1950 with the 681 Turbine . Trying to put the 671M-20 bearing into the Northern made it obvious that it and the race were not designed to be installed together . When the 681-121 race debuted in 1950 , a new rear bearing must have been designed to go with it ; likely , it also had a number starting in 681 . There is no diagram that I know of for LTI 's Northerns , but they are clearly based on the chassis used by the 736 Berk and the 746 J. But the Greenberg 's repair manual shows the 671M-20 rear bearing , together with the 681-121 race , on those engines as well . <p> I finally found what I was looking for in the MPC parts lists . The 8002-100 motor is specified for the N&amp;W J reissue ; there is no diagram , but there , at no. 5 on the parts list , is the missing link @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordered part number 681-120 from a large broker of trains and parts , which shall remain nameless--and they sent us 681-121 , the ball bearing races . They eventually made good on it , but it was a long wait . In the meantime we ordered the bearing you see in the photos from someone else . ( Not sure who , as I did n't do the ordering ; this all started while I was visiting over Christmas , and we just recently got it resolved . ) Moral of that story , asking for the right thing only helps if your vendor is knowledgeable . <p> So now , if you find yourself doing this repair , you know what the part number really is , and hopefully you will be able to get the right part right away . The 681-120 rear bearing is definitely correct for this engine , and should be correct for the 681 , 682 , 671RR , 736 , 726RR , and 746 , as well as their MPC and LTI clones . <p> Oh , just one more thing ... <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and runs more smoothly and quietly than it did when new . 175852 @qwx375852 <p> I do n't have this engine , or have any interest in learning details for repair of one , but just want to say how commendable and generous it is when a member like NICKAIX takes a considerable amount of his time to write a detailed and excellent article like he did , in order to help someone out .

For example , what 's the rest of your layout look like and how is it positioned with respect to this proposed yard ?

Is the turntable solely for turning equipment or do you plan an engine service facility of some kind ? Where ? <p> While you are contemplating these questions , please realize that you have actually constructed two separate yards that are connected by the turntable entry tracks and the half oval . Further , neither yard seems to have a drill track that prevents switching operations from fouling / blocking the " mainline " half oval .

You said that the this extension is coming off the end of your table and that you have a double main line . It appears that you are using AtlasO or similarly complete track system . If O45 is the smallest diameter track that you can use the the outer loop of your double mainline could be O54 . This would give you additional " triangular " space along the outside edge of the yard that would let you extend the ladder tracks . Moving the turntable to inside the curve can make room engine storage tracks .

Any chance you could move the yard 18 inches from the wall ? <p> Jan 175852 @qwx375852 <p> FWIW , I like Jan 's idea , though it does n't include a service facility , etc . Unlike the designs up to this point , it allows a train coming in at the top to run through and then back cars into the slots as well as a train coming in from the bottom to simply back cars into the slots . Since the leftmost slots are short , they could be converted for engine servicing . Also , unless you plan to double park engines , the whisker tracks only have to be long enough for your engines . There 's a reversing loop in there too . <p> I like your ideas . You are right about the extra space in the upper left of the area . Moving the turntable also makes a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upper part of the drawing will be far enough from the wall so I can squeeze through so reach will not be an issue .

One could assume ( ? ) that WBB still has access to a good many former K-Line products , again assuming Kader still owns the former K-Line tooling . <p> Jack Lynch at the past few YORK presentations , has spoke excitedly about the Bluetooth technology gradually coming to the WBB line up , and yet Lionel has now beaten them to that development . <p> One could speculate that sales have been soft : A company does n't devote resources to a product line that does n't make money . That 's simple business 101 . It would also be just as easy to speculate , that even with existing products , that the lack of road name announcements could be discouraging sales . For example , with the recent 44 ton switcher being available in only a few road names . <p> It may not be a big audience but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their interest is n't translating to sales for WBB . <p> Anyways , it would be interesting to hear someone from WBB comment on , or address what the future holds for the Williams line up of products . <p> Just a moment ago , for anyone else who wants to know - someone else asked a similar question on the live stream from TrainWorld . Rich Janyszek answered that there would be some new announcements at the YORK show in a few weeks . He also made mention of the 44 ton switcher and the FP40 that have previously been cataloged . <p> Ken senior of TrainWorld chimed in emphatically and said that sales were anything but soft for the Williams line , especially on products that have been discontinued . Also mentioning that they buy in bulk and then can pass those savings on to the customer . <p> Thus far on the live stream , most of the questions though have been about HO scale and then N scale .

I like the Williams products and the catalogs have become quite anemic in recent years . <p> Any plans for to produce Strasburg Railroad items in any gauge , especially O-gauge or large scale G-gauge ? This tourist railroad is well known and would most likely be received favorably by many railroad enthusiasts . <p> Even though the O scale line may not be as broad as it once was they are focusing in on key items . The F59 will be in late summer and they will be announcing some new tooling at york for williams . He wo n't tell me so your guess is as good as mine . They will make different 44 ton road names down the line . <p> I told him to make more Strasburg railroad items too ! In the video he also talks about more EZ App train in other scales . <p> I know that Williams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that currently operate , and seem mainly to stay away from railroads that went out of business except for Pennsy and NYC . <p> I have researched some railroad history for the state of Pennsylvania and was surprised to learn that the Philadelphia and Reading Railways was a very large and prosperous railroad in the late 1890 's , might even have been the largest railroad in the USA at the time .

I recently started to restore a Berk # 736 Postwar locomotive , that with very bad original wheels ... I already imported US , new wheels for replacement and has started to dismantle , remove the old wheels ... However I found a " problem " and I was anxious to continue the dismantling of the wheels ... My doubt is:How do I Remove the Worm Wheel ( 726-125 ) of locomotia ? If I remove one of the wheels , usually the Worn Wheel , will leave alone ? I am concerned to take this next step without before I take all the doubts ... Thanks for your attention . Big hug Gilbero.P . Luizello <p> I understood ... The right tools may be a problem for me ... I have to look on the Intenet ... However the other wheels I removed perfectly with my gear puller adapted .. I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you very much ... <p> Your title says you have a 736 Berkshire . But the chassis pictured above is from a 1947-1949 726 Berkshire.Some of the parts , such as the wheels and axles are different between the two . I 'd have to check , I think the worm gear may be different too.Lionel never sold wheel cups that would fit a nickel rimmed Berkshire wheel . As far as I know , Hobby Horse is the only outfit that made the proper cup . <p> Judging by the appearance of your chassis , I 'd guess that at least the faces of your axle bearing are worn . I 'd suggest doing one of the following : <p> 1 - replace the axle bearings <p> 2 - put shim washers on the axles between the wheels and the axle bearings . I typically use 671M-19 or 671M-23 washers . <p> Hello guys , good night ... In my " Shell " printed the number 736 ! But as I bought used , I think this locomotive may have suffered " mutations " . I had to remove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of glue to remain fixed to the axes ... The damage here is great ... Yes I also think I will have to replace the bushings on all wheels and I bought these M 671-19 as I saw in Greenberg 's Repair Operating Manual for Lionel Trains 1945 -1969 ... This is my first restoration , I have a lot to learn yet , and especially with the right tools to use ... For here in Brazil I will not find a Lionel pulley puller , I had to adapt one and it worked ... but great care is needed ! I learnThank you for listening to all of you ! ! ! And sorry my English ! Gilberto ... <p> Proper tools are best , but if you wish to attempt riskier homemade effort : <p> You might try cutting washers to a U shape to fill the gap between frame and gear , and pressing the axle out with a vice . You can use them to reassemble also . <p> Once the axle is flush to the frame however , you would need to use a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drift used lightly may be possible at this point used carefully . So might the vice , if you can find something short and stable for pressing with . A drillpress might be used as a press , able to hold a drift straight . If both wheels are removed , putting the axle into a drillpress chuck , you may be able to pull the axle rather than press , but I 'd start with pressing first , as more force is usually needed as a process like this begins , less as it moves along . <p> Also , if you have all new parts ; wheels , bushings , gear , axles , and access to a modeling rotory tool ( Dremel ) and cut off discs ( reinforced are best ) why not cut the brass gear off ? With a drillpress and bit , you might be able to thin the gear enough to crack it in half by twisting a screwdriver to pry it apart . Once the gear is gone the axle should remove much easier . <p> Tape or thick paper on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard wood with a stepped hole , can be used as cups for installing the new parts . Keeping all parts aligned well during reassembly is very important . It is easy to bend an axle while pressing.The result of a bent axle will be a wheel and / or a body wobble as your train runs , and / or rod issues and / or short gear life or gear bind ( locks up ) . <p> The axle with the gear is easily driven out with a pin punch . I recommend using a brass one if available . This eliminates the chance of damaging the end of the axle.As it 's driven through , the splines for the gear may score the inside to the bearing it goes through . I do not know of a way to avoid that.When I install a new bearing , I like to put the shank ( uncut part ) of a tight fitting drill bit in the hole to prevent it from becoming smaller as it is pressed in place.Once again , when the axle is put through , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bearing . If anyone knows a way to avoid this , I would like to read about it.The problem with pressing one wheels without proper cups is the fact that most wheels , including your nickle rimmed berk ones , are not flat . If you do n't care to buy cups , you will have to rig something up.Before Lionel sold presses and cups , they advised repair folks to make their own cups , and use a metal lathe to press on the wheels . This was done by putting the cups in the head stock and tail stock , and advancing the tail stock closed.Not owning a lathe , I 've never tried it . <p> One more comment.Be careful how you move forward with replacing those axle bearings.In your picture above , the bearing for the second axle from the front looks like it probably is correct ( thin and unflanged ) . But the other two look to be too thick . Your chassis may have been modified to use whatever bearings the repair person had available . <p> In air cooled VW motors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the metal contracts allowing the gear to slip on verses being pressed if done quickly . Its actually in at least one manual ( haynes if I recall ) The metal is contracting on its self and the hole becomes larger . It never made sense offhand , but I never did the math either because it works . The same gear will need to be cut , or need a puller to come off . The tolerances there are much closer , but for a train , it may minimize the issue with the splines and even negate pressing the bearing into the frame . I realize the bearings might be bronze ( ? ) and be affected differently ( ? ) but its worth a try ( for CW ) considering the price of a bearing is so cheap . If it works out , try the gear next . <p> I want to point out that freezing the gear is the opposite of normal practice . Most gears.are heated for expansion to do the same job , some even freeze the crank . Either method seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brass that deeply , I was told ( not read ) it was the brass 's contraction properties , thickness , diameter , and hole diameter in combination that made it work . A cold gear is easier to handle than a hot one , I had no issues , got paid by the hour and did as I was asked . I did my own that way 3 times after . Did I get lucky ? I did n't do the math . <p> That said , the main advantage would be the bearings might not need pressing to the frame because that is the outer diameter of the bearing and the OD is shrinking for sure . My not fully understanding about the motors gear was an I 'd contraction based thing . If the gear contracts , seems the hole should too ? ? ? ? ? Math is needed before I 'll ever truly understand what I was doing . <p> Ok guys , I will read and reread all the information , tips and teachings that were posted here and of course try to follow the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I realemente am very grateful for all this attention you are giving me ...

Once again , thank you and a big hug to everyone ! Gilberto ... <p> Is it possible that once the old bearings are out that you can assemble the axle with a new gear in the chassis first and then slide the new bearing over the axle onto the journal and press into the chassis ? This would overcome the problem of putting the bearings in first and damaging them by forcing the knurled part for the gear through one of them . <p> Is it possible that once the old bearings are out that you can assemble the axle with a new gear in the chassis first and then slide the new bearing over the axle onto the journal and press into the chassis ? <p> Sometimes the bearing compresses as it 's being pressed in place and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ axle to bind in the bearing .

The Baldwin disks were used on the 726 which did n't have Magnetraction nor a place to mount magnets , in the frame . So the question is do you have a 736 with 726 drivers or a 726 frame and drivers with a 736 boiler ? <p> I 'm pretty sure there is an old ( b&amp;w ) documentary video that covers that quickly ( like two seconds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch the Euro videos too ....

It came in handy on resetting some loose Marx wheels though the pattern was off . He had arbors for the flat pressed onto car axles too . Bought or made ? ; its tough to say . <p> The 622 geared wheel and axle , the early magnetic axle , came as a replacement part from Lionel with the bearing on the axle between the wheel and the swaging .

You know I thought there was one here at one time . But with all the mention of the shop over the years , I thought it was an east coast thing . <p> When Madison Hardware was owned and run by Lou Shur and his brother Carl , it was in New York City . Lou sold the business to Richard Kughn , who relocated it to Detroit . Often when I mention Madison Hardware , I will put ( NYC ) or ( Detroit ) after it because to me there is a difference . <p> While the business was in Detroit , they would periodically issue sale flyers . I purchased some stuff from those flyers , including wheels and armatures by the pound . The quality of those parts varied . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and some were just garbage .

I have a soft spot for late 40 's early 50 's NH diesels . Especially the warm orange paint schemes . This engine is a fantastic runner . Suprisingly it has a lot of added on details . The stock MTH couplers would not stay coupled to my Kadee equipped rolling stock . After some experimenting before cutting anything up . I was sure it would work . I needed about a 1/8 spacer . I picked up a piece of aluminum at Home Depot that was 1/8 x 1 1/2 by 3ft . . Plenty of material to allow for trial and error . Plastic probably would work just as well . I tend to overbuild things . With the shell off . There are 2 3mm screws that secure the headlight brackets to the die cast chassis . I used these 2 holes to secure the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holes for the spacer using a center punch . The plate requires 4 critical holes . 2 to mount the spacer and 2 to secure the coupler , shim , and steps . These must be drilled square and spaced properly for it to look good . This is why I bought 3 feet of stock . A drill press comes in handy . If you mark it and start to drill and it looks to be off by eye . Stop and flip the piece over and try again . There 's nothing more frustrating than to drill a bunch of holes perfect and then mess up the last one . I have another RS1 to do . Was almost thinking of bringing a master working piece to a machine shop . For nothing else than to make sure the holes are in line . You will need to tap 2/56 holes to mount the coupler and steps . I bought some mounts from Mario . I ended up going with the one for a Lionel RS 11 . The Atlas RS1 looked nice but spaced the coupler to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the body mount screws . <p> Use Mario 's mount as a guide . 2 nubs have to be filed flush . As well as the rounded portion near the couplers head . It fits perfectly inside the pilot to get the holes drilled evenly.After the holes are drilled you can trim the pilot . There 's no turning back now . You can shorten the Kadee 's box for clearance to miss the factory coupler mount . I opted to just trim the mount off the truck seeing I had already cut up the pilot . I did add a small piece of 1/8 x 1/8 brass stock with a no. 60 hole drilled through it and glued it to the shim . I added an air hose off an MTH freight truck . Everything bolts up with 2/56 1/2 " screws . Just using these pieces you should be right on the money height wise . <p> . <p> You can now secure this in place and make some final measurements and trim to fit with a file . It will look something like this when done . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done . You can drop the headlight bracket over the extended threads . Just enough room to secure it on with one nut using an open end wrench <p> I painted everything up and weathered it . This one was a little different . In my steam era . I model the mid 40 's during the war . Everything is heavily weathered . This engine in the year I 'm modeling is only a few years old . I had to learn to go on the lighter side . One thing I never noticed was the placement of the bell . Did n't even know it was there till I dissassembled it . I decided to paint it brass to make it stand out a little more . 175854 @qwx375854 175853 @qwx375853 <h> Block 175862 @qwx375862

@@36015222 @5015222/ <h> STM2 and DZ1000 compatability ? <p> Hi all , I am starting to plan my wiring for my in progress layout . My father has requested that the layout be functional from his Ipad so I have begun looking into using my ross switches with DZ1000 's with the ASC2 modules and the wifi module . My question is can I make use of the STM2 to make the ipad update position of the switch with the DZ1000 's I 'm going to use or is it only really for use with Fastrack switches . I have searched with zero results , comments or examples of someone making the two play nice together . Any thoughts ? <p> The fastrack switch puts out -5 vdc for OUT and +5 vdc for THRU position . I believe the STM2 determines the switch position when it sees 0 volts or less for the OUT position and + 5 vdc or a maybe +2.5 to +5 vdc voltage for THRU . If your DZ puts out anything like that or you can use a relay to output something like that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an S gauge layout that is operated entirely from the LCS app on an iPad , Cab 2 's and iCab apps on iPhones . The layout LCS system has 38 devices operating 50 turnouts , 20 uncouplers , 4 operating tracks , 25 switchable track blocks and about 10 miscellaneous structure lighting controllers . Eight of the turnouts are operated by a DZ2500 . The STM2 reports their position but it requires a relay and a separate 5V power supply to perform that function . Lionel has posted the wiring for this here on the forum about 2 months ago . The Tortoise machines can be connected directly to the STM2 . I do not know about using a DZ1000 . <p> Do not underestimate the time it takes to create the layout mimics in LCS along with all the operating devices and routes . I have six separate screens on the iPad to show all the track loops , yards and interchange tracks .

The relay shown in my drawing is the DZ1008 which I figured was compatible with the DZ stuff as far as if the DZ switch controllers would drive it or not . The 5 vdc supply is something you will have to come up with so you can drive the STM-2 . You could even use 3 AAA cells since the drain from them is so low by the STM-2 which has a high impedance input . Also there are many AC to DC supplies that you can use off ebay these days and here is a link to one that I use routinely connected to my track 18 VAC . Make sure you set the output to around 4.5 vdc ( a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know what the limits of the Lionel stuff is ) or so before you hook it up . <p> Sorry for the slow response , I have been on another business trip . This is the sketch I recall , CJACK is the man ! The DZ1008 is the same relay I have . When at home I will look up the 5VDC supply we used . 175852 @qwx375852 <p> Let us get back on topic ( says the guy who took us off ) - STM2 and DZ1000 compatibility ? <p> I just reviewed the STM manual and it shows a wiring diagram for the Atlas switch plus ACS2 .

( NOTE : ignore the DZ-1008 used for closure rail power . ) <p> The STM2 is looking for either a positive voltage ( 5 VDC ) or zero voltage ( or - ) . For this , I have the STM2 wired to the DZ-1008 common ( blue wire ) , and the DC power supply wired to N/O ( white wire ) . No input to N/C ( gray wire ) . Either green or yellow wire from the DZ-2500 can be attached to the green or yellow wire of the DZ-1008 ; use which ever combination gives the correct input on the LCS screen . <p> Hopefully someone smarter than me will either say this is correct or not . <p> Ron 175860 @qwx375860 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm working on a project for my future layout . In the last week I have purchased a DZ-2500 , DZ-1008A , Data Wire Driver , STM2 , and SER2 . This evening I set-up everything on my " bench " and tried to get the STM2 working with the DZ-2500 with DZ-1008A . Unfortunately , I was unable to get it to work . <p> I followed CJack 's diagram below . I connected the Common ( blue wire ) to position 1 of the STM2 . My 5+ VDC was connected to the NC on DZ-1008A and then the 5- VDC to NO on DZ-1008A went to the Switch Sense on the STM2 and was also connected to 5- VDC ground from the wall wart . I tried both the green or yellow wire from the DZ-1008A to the green wire on the DZ-2500 . I also tried it with both the green and yellow both connected from the DC-1008A to the DZ-2500 . The DZ-2500 works perfectly when thrown from the cab-2 , iPad , or push button . I did program the STM2 as indicated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( green ) light does n't light-up at all when I throw the switch , but the STM2 is getting PDI commands ( red light ) . <p> Does anyone have an idea what might be the problem ? This what I really need for this project is the STM2 properly working and sensing when the switch changes . <p> Not sure why I drew only one green coming out of the DZ1008 , but there is a green and a yellow and they go to the green and the yellow respectively on the DZ2500 and also to the antiderailing track rails on the switch . Is that what you have ? <p> Now I have NO hooked to the com on the STM2 , but where does the gnd from the 5v DC supply get tied to the circuit ? <p> This was one of the questions I hoped would be answered in my diagram ( 2nd one ) above . I think the ground goes to the STM2 sense return but nobody has commented on that yet .

I think the ground goes to the STM2 sense return but nobody has commented on that yet . Hopefully we can get this to work because I really like the concept . <p> From what I understand the STM2 is basically seeing if there are 0 to 5v . I originally hooked up the NO to position 1 on the STM2 then com on the DZ-1008A to 5v , and 5v gnd to com on STM2 , but no go . That is with both green and yellow wires hooked up to DZ-2500 <p> Not sure why I drew only one green coming out of the DZ1008 , but there is a green and a yellow and they go to the green and the yellow respectively on the DZ2500 and also to the antiderailing track rails on the switch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why I used the green into the DZ1008 to switch the relay . Green is the wire that will toggle the DZ1008 on or off . The yellow wire in the DZ1008 is just passed thru to the fixed terminals . <p> The schematic of the DZ1008 is : <p> As you can see , Red is power to the relay coil and Green is the signal to the transistor that turns the relay on and off . So the extra 5 vdc supply should have it 's positive +5 vdc connected to the NO contact on the DZ1008 and the minus side of the 5 vdc supply should be connected to the Com contact of the DZ1008 AND also connected to the SENSE RETURN of the STM-2 . <p> My drawing shows either Green or Yellow coming from the original DZ Switch Circuit ( which has it 's own switch machine and DZ1008 as shown in CAPPilot 's drawing ) going to the Green on the EXTRA DZ1008 relay THAT we are adding to use the STM-2 . The Green or Yellow from the Switch is decided as CAPPilot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result on the STM-2 . <p> I did n't check the original DZ Switch Circuit in CAPPilot 's drawing but assume it is a correct copy of the drawing for wiring up a DZ switch on the Z Stuff site . <p> In CAPPilots drawing my only correction would be to connect the 5 vdc Com wire that goes to our extra DZ1008 NO contact also to the Sense Return on the STM-2 . <p> My original drawing : <p> I should have drawn a wire from the DZ1008 NO contact to the STM-2 Sense Return . The STM-2 needs to see +5 or Com at it 's Switch Sense terminal for the two conditions of the switch ... and that comes from Com on the DZ1008 depending on whether the DZ1008 is energized or not from it 's Green wire . <p> I think this all we can conjure from the information given by the various manufacturers of the components . I find the lack of schematics from both Lionel and Z Stuff to be very troublesome . <p> The STM-2 should show some result depending on the +5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If it does n't change with the changing of the switch , then it is the fault of the Yellow or Green wires coming from the original DZ Switch Circuit not turning on our extra DZ1008 relay . <p> Looking at the hand drawn sketch above the DC(-) connection to the STM2 Sense return seems to be missing . It is the blue wire on the STM2 wiring diagram I posted about 10 posts above . Chris , this connection is listed as the second bullet item as ( - ) 5V in your post but not on the wiring diagram if that is what you followed . The Sense return should be zero volts , not ( - ) 5V , referenced to the ( + ) 5V . <p> The Sense 1 position should see either an open circuit or ( + ) 5V depending on which way the turnout is thrown . Trust that the STM2 I 'd is set and single wire mode is selected during the setup . <p> I hope this is of some help . Mine are working reliably but I am using ASC2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always correct , matching the turnout position . <p> What do you get so far ?

I greatly appreciate it . <p> Thus far I have the switch machine hooked up and working properly by the Cab-2 , iPad , and pushbutton . When I throw the switch from the pushbutton the iPad LCS app does n't update the switch position at all . Please note that I only have one relay hooked-up in this test . I do n't have two relays indicated in the diagram above . When I build my layout there will be two . One for non-derail and the other for the STM2 . <p> Now on my setup I connected the voltmeter on the green wire from the relay to the comm ( black ) from the relay and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ switch machine with track power ( 18 VAC ) . I also connected the voltmeter on the output of the DZ-1008A to see when the switch is thrown thru or out if I lose voltage . I connected the positive side of my meter to the COMM ( blue , relay ) to N/C and got 5 VDC no matter if the switch was thru or out . <p> I think this confirms my theory that there is something going on with the relay . <p> I ca n't find any DZ1000-DZ1008 schematic that is complete . Just one for the 2500 and some words about the DZ1000 . Juse need to see how the relay is switched and by what from the DZ1000 .

The AC inverter compartment on the fireman 's side of the engine has four " X " panels . It should have the bolt on panels as depicted on the real engine . The " X " panels were on later production units . I mention this because MTH did it correctly for their CSX AC4400 engines . Once again , attention to detail . Overall the sound is good with a definite rumble compared to a Dash 8 . For the money it was worth it . I ca n't compare it to the Lionel version but from what I 've seen Lionel got the AC side panels right and may have a " super bass " speaker to enhance the sound of a 6000 hp locomotive . The Lionel front coupler sticks out like a battering ram . Appears to be a nice engine but I would not buy one for $699.00. 175854 @qwx375854 175853 @qwx375853 <h> Block 175862 @qwx375862

The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you need to really be concerned about is the min curve the rolling stock is designed to run on , rather than the exact car size . Some custom O guage rolling stock may very well be smaller in design than some actual 027 rolling stock , it all depends on the design of the individual car . <p> PCRR/Dave 175857 @qwx375857 <p> I think everything is okay to use . I just ensure that I put the full scale stuff all on one train with a full-sized engine(s) and vice-versa . I do n't mix undersized O with full sized O. It does look funny to me to see an 89 foot auto carrier trailing an engine that it just absolutely overwhelms in size . <p> I run some Weaver outside braced wood cars with Williams and MTH Railking cars and they look fine together because the wood cars were smaller prototypes . The Weaver cars do n't look good with Lionel 6464 cars as they are smaller than the Williams and MTH cars . <p> I have a Lionel #731 Freight set from the fifties that I believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Snow , Wood Sided Refer Box Car to add to the set which has O-Gauge on the box and it seems a bit smaller than the cars in the #731 Set , especially the original New Haven Box car in the Lionel #731 Set . <p> John <p> The New Haven box car in your No. 731 set should be a 6468-25 . It is a " traditional " O gauge or O-27 gauge car that is not a scale model of any particular real world freight car . <p> If your K-line reefer is a K642 it would be shorter then the Lionel 6468 box car . A K-line 742 reefer would be larger the the K642 and about the same size as a Lionel 6464 or 6468 box car . <p> Lionel , MTH and Atlas all have O and O-27 sized toy train product lines . And they all have O scale product lines . <p> Lionel calls its toy trains " traditional . " Since the 1970s Lionel 's scale products are marketed as " Standard O. " Some of them , like the Lionel PS-1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rail O scale modelers as very dimensionally accurate and well detailed . <p> MTH calls their toy oriented products " Rail King " and of those product numbers begin with a 30- . Some of the Rail King freight cars are 1:48 scale . They are generally based on pre WW II cars that were of smaller size and do not dwarf more fanciful cars . Some Rail King steam and diesel locomotives are 1:48 scale and are advertized as Rail King Scale . MTH 's highly detailed O scale models are in their " Premier " line and have 20- product numbers . <p> I could be mistaken but , I do n't believe any Postwar period ever mentioned " size " in their descriptions . Another words , I do n't ever remember seeing a catalog from the 1950 's described a " 40 ' " boxcar . It would simply be listed as a boxcar . About the only descriptive difference I remember was a " Double Door " box car . But still no mention of 40 ' , 50 ' or whatever . With the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start until perhaps the 1980 " s ? <p> So , as mentioned previous , there were no standards for manufacturers to follow . I betcha a 40 ' boxcar from Lionel , MTH , Weaver , Williams , and K-line all put side by side would have differences in length , width , height . <p> So for a new guy who is looking for some sort of consistency could get flustered rather quickly . <p> This subject is more complicated than it should be mainly due to terminology differences over the years . <p> When I was growing up ( late 60s thru early 80s ) , my Grandpa referred to his stuff as O27 and my Uncle 's as O-Gauge . But , there was as much commonality as there were differences . The main difference was track ..... my uncle 's O-Gauge had a higher profile ( taller ) which provides better electrical connectivity , 31 " diameter curves , and O22 switches with separate power terminals and non-derailing . The O27 track was shorter , came with 27 " curves , and 1121 switches that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . RE : O27 was a bit cheaper . <p> When it came to locomotives and rolling stock , my uncle had two sets that were two big to handle the 27 " curves of O27 .... the Virginian Trainmaster set and the Santa Fe F3s with 15 " passenger cars . In today 's vernacular these engines were ( or were close to ) 1:48 scale . But , even though my uncle ran " O Gauge " , some of his stuff ran fine on O27 like his 2023 UP FAs and a 2-6-2 steamer . He did not own the 773 4-6-4 Hudson which was , I think , the only steam engine close to 1:48 scale in that era , nor did he own the 2-8-4 Berkshire which I believe was rated for minimum 31 " curves . <p> The problem is that O27 does not always mean non-scale or semi-scale . My grandpa 's O27 stuff included a 0-4-0 1656 steam switcher and an NW-2 diesel switcher both of which I 'm told are close to 1:48 scale . But , because yard switchers are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curves . <p> I ended up inheriting my grandpa 's O27 collection . I 've found that Lionel Traditional , MTH Rugged Rails , and Atlas Industrial Rail are safe matches . MTH Rail King is at least a little larger and , in some cases , absurdly larger , so I 'm very careful with Rail King purchases . K-line items are usually safe for size matches unless they specifically say " O Scale " . <p> Some of these distinctions are no longer relevant . If you run O27 tubular track , you can now purchase 42 " and 54 " curves to allow for operation of bigger engines and rolling stock . <p> It would be great if a majority of the manufacturers would come up with a standard for future buyers . I 'm thankful to have an exclusive " local " O scale shop so I may see a lot of products prior to purchasing them . <p> Some of the early O-27 was actually 3/16 " ( 1:64 ) scale . American Flyer started it before WWII , then Marx and even Lionel to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marx " scale " O-gauge trains are 3/16 " , the big tin #21 EMD A units being the main exception . <p> Andy <p> When they were passing out brains , I thought they said trains and I asked for a slow one . <p> Scotie , what we have here , from top to bottom in the first photo or left to right in the lower photo , are a Weaver 40 ' DL&amp;W , an unknown maker of NH ( but may be based on the AMT/KMT mold ) , Lionel Penn 19212 ( 6464 size ) , Lionel NYC X3464 and Lionel 9040 Wheaties . <p> There is such a drastic difference from smallest to largest that I do n't usually run the smallest and the largest in the same train . Rather , I may couple up the Weaver with cars down to the X3464 size , or the Wheaties size with cars up to the NH size in a consist ( if that makes any sense ) . <p> I am definitely saving these two pictures ! Thanks for posting . I 've been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last year . I got a lot of the same answers mentioned here but as they say , " a picture is worth ... ' <p> So what you are saying is , even though the cars are O or O-27 gauge and they should all be the same size for these gauges , the manufactures of the cars use <p> different methods to calculate the scale of the cars and also the time the cars where produced also is a factor on the size of the cars . <p> Am I at least in the same ballpark ? <p> When I bought the Phoebe Snow Refer Car , I saw O gauge on the box and I thought that it would match my Lionel # 731 Set cars perfectly but after putting the car in the set I quickly saw the difference in size with the rest of the cars , especially the New Haven Box Car . <p> If you want to purchase a separate car for a certain train set like I did , what do you have to do to get the same size car to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Car I purchased was a special edition car and its not like I had a lot of choice of different companies to buy this car so it would be an exact match , size wise , to match my Lionel 731 Set Cars . <p> K-Line was the only company that I know of that manufactured this Phoebe Snow Refer Car so I had to buy this companies rolling stock if I wanted this particular car . <p> So what you are saying is , even though the cars are O or O-27 gauge and they should all be the same size for these gauges , the manufactures of the cars use <p> different methods to calculate the scale of the cars and also the time the cars where produced also is a factor on the size of the cars . <p> Am I at least in the same ballpark ? <p> Just a point of clarification ... people use the terms scale and gauge interchangeably . That is incorrect . Gauge is only the distance between the rails . Scale has to do with the proportion of the object @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't answer your question but please do n't ask me why/how the various manufacturers decide to build something to what size they decide . I imagine a lot has to do with money . <p> There are no standards in O gauge . If enough of us would ever get together and pressure the manufacturers by not buying anything except whatever the agreed standard was that would work . It 's also a pipe dream and incredible long shot . <p> Question 2 : If you want to purchase a separate car for a certain train set like I did , what do you have to do to get the same size car to match the set cars ? <p> Go to a local place and take one with you to match up or ask an on-line seller to give you the exact dimensions of the piece--many do . <p> Question 3 : <p> Can anyone explain to me how you figure these scale ratios out ? <p> The actual meaning of O scale is 1/48 . It is also referred to as quarter inch scale mean one inch on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a forty foot boxcar in real life is ten inches long in O scale . <p> Most people do n't ... try to figure out the scale ratios that is . The only place where you expect a consistent scale is with the high-end products specifically billed as ( or implied to be ) scale-proportioned . Starter-set trains ( especially from the postwar period ) ... were n't . <p> When these " traditional size " cars were developed in the mid-20th century , they were developed as toys , and there was n't any thought given to keeping a consistent scale throughout the lineup , much less co-ordinating with other manufacturers . The only numbers you 'll see here are made-up ratios , since a good number of postwar-peroid models are n't even based upon specific prototypes where you could compare blueprints to derive a specific ratio of reduction . <p> Besides , during that period , real freight trains had highly inconsistent rooflines , providing even less incentive for toy train companies to do so . In contrast , HO and N scales were created with scale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the form of a large installed base of product built with no specific scale in mind . <p> There is a lot of good info that should help clarify things in the last few posts . Just to illustrate John C. 's distinction between scale and gauge , look at this photo . Both cars are O-gauge because they were made to run on O-gauge track . But I do n't believe that anyone would ever confuse one for the other . <p> For that reason I did n't include the 6 " Marx car in my original photos . But such a ridiculous comparison should implant permanently in anyone the idea of the difference between scale and gauge . <p> Rice Burner - as you are modelling a vintage train , I would n't even think about the difference in size in the new car you bought . Just check videos of home movies from the Fifties and early Sixties and you 'll see what I mean . <p> For the most part the wheels and trucks for 3-rail rolling stock are roughly the same size . Take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> You can judge what size the boxcar is by simply looking at the scale of the car to its trucks , and by looking at the distance between the trucks . <p> Exactly . This is how I think about it . It 's all O-gauge since " gauge " is the distance between the outside rails . <p> For Rice Burner : <p> The term " O27 " is a little misleading , at least it was to me at first . The " 27 " refers to the minmum radius of a curve . " O " or " O31 " refers to track with a minimum radius of a curve . <p> However there is another difference , the height of the rail/track . Without going into the details the " O " is taller . <p> This leads to 2 issues . <p> 1 ) Track height incompatibility . Some switches which are made to the " O27 " standard will not run all wheels/trucks and/or engines with certain types of wheels . Generally the flanges are to tall and contact areas in the switches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radius incompatibility . Larger rolling stock and engines wo n't do 27 " curves . The wheels do n't simply ca n't stay inside the rails on that sharp a turn or they so overhang as to be an eyesore or hazardous to trackside elements . The 31 " curve is more or less the base standard in most of " O " railroading today . Though of course there are models of prototypes that are very large and and will only run on even larger curves 54 " , 60 " , 72 " , etc . <p> " O " railroading , being a " toy " railroad was not made in consistent sizes as can be seen in the pictures and here LONG ... so you have in some cases " O27 sized " cars which are generally the smallest and can range down to 1/55 though I 've seen some that are pushing S dimensions 1/64 up to true 1/48 scale cars/engines . You just have to look at a lot of cars to get a feel for it . And then decide if it matters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Phoebe Snow Refer Car , I saw O gauge on the box and I thought that it would match my Lionel # 731 Set cars perfectly but after putting the car in the set I quickly saw the difference in size with the rest of the cars , especially the New Haven Box Car . <p> Is this the car you have , K762-1471 ? <p> If so it was made about 50 years after your 6468 box car . Why would you expect a 50 year old toy to perfectly match something made 50 years later by another company ? <p> Can anyone explain to me how you figure these scale ratios out ? <p> Sure <p> If you buy Atlas Master Line , Atlas Trainman , Lionel Standard O or MTH Premier you will be buying a 1:48 scale model . If you buy something else you may be buying a 1:48 scale model , a scale model of some other ratio , a toy that has been " selectively compressed " from a real world prototype or simply a toy based on nothing more than the designers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the parents who bought toys for them . <p> If you decide to go the all 1:48 scale route you should be aware that real world freight cars , even box cars and reefers , were never made to perfectly match each other . <p> I have no problems with the difference with the terms of Gauge and Scale , the term gauge measures the distance between the outer rails of the track , as noted , and the term scale is a comparison of the size of a model compared to the size of the real life item , expressed as a ratio , for example 1:48 , what I wanted to know is what the first number represents and what the second number of the ratio represents . <p> If something is 1:48 is the first number one inch of the model verses 48 inches of the real life item ? <p> Why would I not expect it to be the same size of the cars in my fifty year old Lionel set ? Maybe it would be the same , maybe it would not , in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottom line of this whole issue is that different manufacturers , use different criteria for the same scale and sometimes they also used different criteria for the same scale based on the time period the model item was produced .

@@36015235 @5015235/ <h> Lionel 224e and 226e questions <p> My two oldest engines are a 224E and 226E . The are both in fabulous cosmetic shape and run great . My question about the 224 is this ..... the e-unit is dead quiet . Unbelievable actually . All you hear is the slow " click " of the plunger when it changes gears . No solenoid buzz . How is that possible ? Not a complaint , just amazed every time I run it . <p> As for the 226E , my question is ...... it takes much more voltage to run it . If my other engines ( PW and the 224 ) run at normal speeds at 10 or 12V , the 226 needs 16 . It runs very smoothly and is a great puller , but what accounts for the higher voltage need ? <p> Make sure nothing is binding in the wheels or drive train . How is the grease ? Compare rolling the wheels with your fingers to the 224 , is there a big difference ? I had this issue on my own 224 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . It ran but it needed 15V . <p> I think the heavier body casting and frame on the 224 helps to quiet down the E unit . Have you taken the 226 apart and given it a good cleaning ? The brushes may be worn out and the comutator may be dirty . <p> The first thing I do when I get any " new " PW ( or pre ) engine is .... replace the brushes and springs , clean the commutator and e-unit and then lube . So , I 'm not thinking that 's the problem . I have a feeling that the motor itself in that engine naturally uses more voltage . <p> Buzzing e units can be fixed . did many years ago . May have pictures yet somewhere and will look for them . <p> Issue is the E unit plunger travel and being fed with AC . I recall glueing a thin piece of foam material to prevent plunger travel from allowing it to seat all the way upward . This also helped the plunger from failing to drop between cycles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think also in later years I added a full wave rectifier to feed the circuits with DC rather than AC to eliminate buzz altogether . I will look tonight after a round of golf . <p> The older ones , are most easily identified by the paper wrapping on the coil . These e-units have a brass tube in the center , and use a plunger with a plain , flat end on top . <p> The newer e-units have an exposed coil wire that is wrapped on a plastic form . The center tube is part of the form . These e-units have a cone shaped depression cut into the top end of the plunger . There is a corresponding metal coil stop at the top of the tube , attached to the metal bracket that holds the coil . <p> In addition , the shape of the pawl is a little different . <p> I wrote this because when looking at techniques for quieting e-units , the type of e-unit probably makes a difference . <p> CWB : There was also a version that could be used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solenoid to the released position . <p> It 's the earlier style with a spring added . The top of the plunger is machined to accept the end of the spring . It is shown twice on the service manual page dated 9-49 . The only difference between the two is the length of the wire leads . <p> Okay ..... just came up from running the 226 . First I checked it for grease , lube , condition of the commutator ( just to be sure ) . As I mentioned , I did all that maintenance when I bought that engine about a year and a half ago . It was all good . I also spun the wheels and there are no binds I could feel . Ran it forward , ran it in reverse . At 16V , it ran at the same speed in both directions . No hitches , no jerky jerk . <p> So , as GGG found with his , maybe it just is more of a voltage hog . But .... the fact that the engine is the same as that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a weight thing or .... gearing . I 'm leaning towards gearing until told otherwise . <p> Roger , thanks . The reason I asked is that Lionel made several brush plates that are interchangeable physically but not electricly . The wrong brush plate would show up in the loco going slower in one direction . <p> One pay to check the brush plate is to draw an imaginary line betwen the tips of the field magnet , and another between the centerlines of the brush holders . These two lines should be perpendicular . If parallel or at a 45-degree angle , the loco has the wrong brush plate . It happened on my 224 , when my father had a broken plate replaced while I was a kid . Discovered the problem many years later . <p> Sorry I could n't help and put you to some effort . <p> It 's easy enough to check the gear ratios . Count the number of revolutions of the armature to one of the driving wheels . <p> Roger , thanks . The reason I asked is that Lionel made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Count the number of revolutions of the armature to one of the driving wheels . <p> Does the 226E have a smoke bulb by any chance ? <p> The 226E was a prewar production and did not have any type of smoking mechanism . If this particular unit has one it has obviously been altered and that might explain the added voltage necessary to run the engine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pleasure . The give and take on here is always amazing . People with common interests helping each other . It does n't get better than that . <p> Bottom line on this thread ..... I 've got a 224E with a dead silent e-unit and a 226E that runs and looks great , but just uses more voltage to do it . Nothing wrong with either of them , it 's just the way they run . <p> Buzzing e units can be fixed . did many years ago . May have pictures yet somewhere and will look for them . <p> Issue is the E unit plunger travel and being fed with AC . I recall glueing a thin piece of foam material to prevent plunger travel from allowing it to seat all the way upward . This also helped the plunger from failing to drop between cycles . <p> I will look in my files tonight . I think also in later years I added a full wave rectifier to feed the circuits with DC rather than AC to eliminate buzz altogether . I will look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ researched my old notes and offer this information based on my years of working on Lionel E-Units . It is information learned and lifted from a variety of sources and there are other excellent experts on this site about these techniques . <p> First , let me say that my recollection of glueing a piece of matchbook cover to prevent total travel of the plunger to the top was placed on top of the pawl and its only purpose was to prevent the E-Unit from hanging up , not necessarily prevent the BUZZ ' . <p> Secondly , a simple easy method is to adjust the pawl . It works , but only on some units . E-units can be adjusted to eliminate much of the buzz by slightly straightening the arm that hangs down from the plunger that catches the e-unit drum . Just straighten out the arm a little at a time until most of the buzz is gone but the e-unit still cycles . If the arm is straightened too much the e-unit will be sporatic in operation. ( hanging up ) If this happens just slightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cycles properly , or add the glued on piece . With a little practice this may be all you need . <p> Finally , the electronic fix is the best but requires some work . <p> It is about 10 millimeters in diameter and rated at about 1.5 amperes , 50 volts or more . The 4 leads are probably marked + , - , , and . <p> Disconnect the coil from the two terminals where it is now connected . Connect the rectifier 's leads to those terminals . Connect the coil to the rectifier 's + and - leads . So , before : <p> My 736 is heavier than the 226 , or at least close and even that runs at lower voltage . <p> -Roger <p> The 736 is post war based off the 226 , but is a whole new and different animal . Post war motor is more efficient and there may have been gearing changes as well . <p> Gandy <p> I think there are a good many people that would dispute the fact that the post-war Berkshire motors were more efficient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as the 224E and the 225E engines is almost universally accepted as the best Lionel ever manufactured . Just from a personal perspective I have a good selection of both the pre-war engines and the post-war Berkies as well and my observation is that the 224E , 225E and the 226E run much smoother and quieter than any of the Berkshires . To be clear , I 'm not bad mouthing the Berkshires because they are my favorite post-war steam locomotives its just the motors are superior in the pre-war engines . . <p> Hmm . It was always my understanding that the motors for the 224E and 226E were a little different . However , I would be shocked to find the difference is in the gear ratios . Lionel 's 1938 catalog puts their spur-geared motor at 12:1 , but I believe the actual ratio is less than 11:1 . It would be neat to find out for sure . Turn the wheels slowly with your thumb and count the armature poles as they go by . Then divide by three , let us know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time was that it runs about the same speed as a 224 or any postwar 6-wheel spur-geared loco . My guess is that your loco has hardened lube in its axle bearings , worn brushes , or a lack of brush spring tension . Measuring the average current ( amps ) when pulling a normal-sized freight on flat track is the easiest way to tell if all is well . If the current draw is a lot higher than your 224 it may be running hot , which will contribute to motor failure in the long run . <p> One thing I 'm pretty sure of is that Lionel switched to fewer turns of a heavier gauge wire after the WWII , and especially after the adoption of sintered iron wheels with magne-traction . I 'll bet burned out field windings were a pretty rare failure by the late 1940s . But taking into account manufacturing costs and everything else I guess Lionel 's management decided that fewer turns of heavier-gauge wire were the way to go . Interesting topic ! -Ted <p> You all may as well throw in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they all had the same motors . <p> In the old days for sluggish runner on a repair , I took the motor out , put it into a bath of mineral spirits , let it soak , brushed out all the old oil and grease , blew it dry , oiled it up and moved on to the next one . <p> Interesting though , the early 675 with iron tires had a wobble effect . Learned how to take the wobble out also . But that 's another story . <p> I do n't know when the O versus O-27 differences kicked in , but PW O engines had higher voltage requirements . It only takes a few more or less windings in the Armature of Field windings to make the effect . I guess it would have a different part number though . Does anyone actually have an original parts manual for these engines ? <p> Ok ..... I just went downstairs to do a few measurements . I hooked a consist to the 224 that had enough cars in it to make the wheels spin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ underway at constant speed . I then replaced the 224 with the 226 and at approximately the same speed , it measured 2.5amps ( and of course , higher voltage to do it ) . I 'm not thinking that 's a major amperage difference . Am I correct in thinking that ? 175854 @qwx375854 175853 @qwx375853 <h> Block 175862 @qwx375862

You would have to get into which were built by Berwick and which were built by P-S to call a car number " incorrect " for the Atlas model .

Using the shorter switches I can manage 43 " to 48 " curves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scarm appear to be much longer than the Atlas ones I have ( #5L and #5R ) and what other solutions are possible ? <p> I will be scratch building most of my switches and am considering curved within curves to help with my space problem . <p> Now is the time we 2-Rail folk see the benefits of HO and S Scale with space issues . <p> While I 'm no expert , I believe the Atlas 12 " switches you have were imported from Austria back in the 1960s and/or 1970s . The Atlas track in SCARM is based on the more current track products Atlas imports from China or somewhere in the Far East . Mixy , the SCARM developer , might be willing to work with you in creating an " older " version of Atlas 2-rail track if you can provide him with the dimensions he needs for data input . <p> Just a thought , but have you tried the Atlas version of SCARM ? If your switches are the older ones it may not help and the programs could have the identical track @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SCARM for their new track design software . It is available on Atlas ' website . I 'm not a SCARM user , but others here are and may be able to provide more help . <p> I bought these Roco switches on Ebay recently- they look to be shorter than the newer no.5 switches Atlas sells . As soon as I get them , I 'll see if they 're the same height as the older Atlas/ Roco track , and compare them to the newer no.5 switches . I intend to use them for industrial sidings . <p> Based on your excellent suggestions and comments I have decided to scrap the whole idea of using these Atlas switches . But , I 'm not mad at you guy 's , just myself . <p> The picture shows that the 60 's era Atlas switch is a real 12 " beauty not much good for any layout I hope to have . It 's only a 24 " radius switch . You ought to have seen the fun I had getting two 80 ' passenger cars through it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the real switches work in my layout . Prior to sealing the deal , I plan to post the completed Scarm layout here for you to comment on . <p> While I still will scratch build my switches , they certainly wo n't be 24 " radius . Possibly double that with plenty of easements . <p> Thanks to all who have responded . We certainly do n't need to add obsolete stock to an otherwise excellent program . <p> I do n't believe that would work . I looked at some Ross 3R curved switches for a guide . <p> They reduce the turnout radius enough to keep it inside of thru near the end . <p> In SCARM , I used the flex tool and created a double sectional 48 " radius curve or 45- . I then copied and pasted another section . <p> I then used the " create parallel start point tool " by right clicking the beginning start point and used 0 " spacing , right or left , does n't matter , opposite direction to create a perfectly aligned start point for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flex track , and set 43 " radius and an 53- of arc . ( That used up most of the flex track ) . Then I created a flex curve at 43 " radius and 37- to complete the 90- of the turnout . <p> The result is posted below with the SCARM file . <p> yes , it 's a work-around for a hand made switch . It will just take more than 45- to make it happen . <p> I would be lost trying to build that switch . it looks like the points would be rather long . <p> When to want to add a track in the layout on the start of the switch , select the base curve . It highlights to red . Then , when you connect a new piece to that end , it will join on that point and not the top turnout piece . <p> I did n't check what the resulting center rail to center rail spacing would be . You could add a couple of straights and check it . 175854 @qwx375854 175853 @qwx375853 <h> Block 175862 @qwx375862

@@36015251 @5015251/ <h> Is it possible to have an O gauge micro layout and run Lionel 86 ' boxcars ? ... YES ! <p> There are a lot of designs on the web for micro layouts ; many of them are in HO , N , and Z , and I 'd say 3/4 of them are narrow gauge . If , however , you define a " micro " layout as any layout that is 4 square ft. or under in area , I have created a track plan using standard Ross Custom Switches pieces that allows you to run those 2 foot-long autoracks or really cool Lionel 86 ' auto parts boxcars in a micro layout 's footprint . <p> A few measurement things to note : <p> I measured the layout 's length and width with SCARM 's tape measure tool , so I ca n't give an ironclad guarantee that the length and width measurements are accurate . Additionally . I measured it from the ends of the crossties , so the track will run right at the edge of your baseboard . <p> The layout is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) wide . The track plan itself is fairly simple , with two parallel sidings connected by a pair of RCS 11-degree turnouts . The key to operating the layout ( aside from using a small engine like a Lionel Trackmobile or K-Line Plymouth ) , is what occurs under the big gray structure on the right side of the above pictures . The track closest to the backdrop ( the big blue square ) under the gray building is the staging track . Here , cars are inserted and removed from the layout via the operator 's hand or a car-lift that descends under the layout . Additionally , by removing a car and then running the switcher through the building , the operator can run around the car without a run-around track ( or just use two locomotives ) . <p> The siding on the right that is closest to the edge of the layout is the auto plant siding . Here , up to two scale modern autoracks or 89 ' boxcars can be stored . The operator must come up with a creative method to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , since the switching lead can only accommodate one car and the locomotive . <p> The other long siding ( in the back left corner of the layout ) has various uses . It can be used as another lead track to facilitate easier switching of the auto plant . Or , to add an additional layer of complexity and variety to switching operations , the siding can be used for additional industries , perhaps even an auto parts manufacturer so as to provide another place to switch those 86 ' boxcars . <p> For one final twist , there is a grade crossing in front of the auto plant that can not be blocked by a standing car . <p> This plan is not perfect , but I believe it is one of the few micro layout plans in O gauge that allow the usage of such big cars . If anyone ever decides to construct this layout , I would be very interested in seeing how it turns out and how you operate it . My email is in my profile . <p> I am NOT charging for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I would very appreciate ( if you ever make this plan ) that you do not adopt this idea as your own .

The links will make them easier to find . <p> I agree that the P&amp;Ds look closest to the ATSF Prototype . <p> I have already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 of them on the Milwaukee F7s . If they look similar enough to the P&amp;Ds , I may use them on the K-Line ATSF F3s . <p> It is hard to tell from Lionel 's photo , but it looks like the main differences between the two are that the P&amp;D has cutouts for the hoses , the anticlimber which will need to be removed , and a smaller coupler opening . If it looks like the Lionel ones are easier to mount , I may keep them and drill out the cutouts . <p> I assume the one to get is PDP5132 . It drives me crazy that P&amp;D does not post pictures of most of their parts . <p> Here is the k-line F3 with the Lionel diecast pilot mounted . In its current mounting location , the bottom of the pilot is 10 scale inches above rail height . The body features are spot on in height above rail . So do I lower the body 6 scale inches to meet the pilot or do I raise the pilot ? Even though the body is at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad 16 " above the rail . 175852 @qwx375852 <p> According to my Central diagrams , its 14 ' 0-1/2 " to the top of the body . <p> That 's 3.510 " actual inches from the top of the rail height . In this case , you ca see that the anti-climber is all the way up on shell , flush with the bottom . On the prototype , the rubbed anti-climber is centered on the side sill . 175852 @qwx375852 <p> Eyeballing the photo with the scale rule in my last post , it looks like my car body height is correct at 14 scale feet . I see the problem with the anticlimber placement . See photos . <p> Given the limitations of the K-Line units that I am starting with , I 'm going to have to go for " look and feel " rather than prototype dimensions . I think the appearance would be improved the most by lowering the shell 1/8 . " This will improve the high water pants look and bring the body down to the pilot at it 's current location @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shorten the shell mounting lugs . If I can only get 1/16 " , I 'll add a 1/16 " spacer as Doug suggested . Lowering at the truck level would require machining ( no easy " add some washers " method ) . <p> I 'm really pleased with the $15 Lionel Pilot . It is nicely detailed , diecast ( I expected plastic ) and comes with coupler bars and one hose installed . It matches the Milwaukee Road prototype F7s perfectly . The prototype Santa Fe F3s have some additional cutouts for hoses , but it is a pretty good match otherwise . <p> This morning I cut the mounting posts by 4 scale inches . The flywheels should clear , but when I tested it , I had some binding . It did not run well and current draw was 4.5 amps . I loosened the shell screws and it dropped to 2.5 amps . I ran out of time to troubleshoot it . <p> If I am successful at lowering the body , the pilot is still 12 scale inches off the railhead . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close the gap some more . <p> It 's not going to pass for a Sunset/3rd Rail model , but fix mounting a new pilot and using Kadees will make a huge improvement .

I will be pulling eleven 21 " K-line aluminum cars . 175852 @qwx375852 <p> Bob I 've never seen the inside of the K-Line F units , but my Lionel F3s had 3 different spots that were rubbing the flywheels after I lowered them . The one that took me a bit to figure out was the cab interior roof that was used to house the two interior light bulbs . The shell was pushing that part of the " roof " down on top of the front flywheel . I also had to grind down a couple spots of the shell for the rear flywheel . The Dremel made quick work out of those , and I ended up removing the interior " roof " anyway because I took the lights out completely .

It does eliminate or at least minimize the thickness of the spacer needed between the pilot and the shell . My MTH FTs are not being lowered because of the way the motor directly attaches to the truck block . It would be a major modification which would also cause a major clearance issue for the smoke unit . Same with my Lionel F7s , hence the .125 spacer .

I filled the gap with 2 strips of 3/16 wide styrene glued in with ACC and filled/sanded twice with Tamiya white putty .

That is the original flat-topped incandescent bulb . It is a press fit in the shell . The original upper headlight now has an LED behind it running off a MARS simulator circuit I built . <p> There were some projections in the shell that I already flattened with the Dremel .

I 'm not sure if I like it or not . Please advise what track he would recommend if I choose to redo the layout with new track and switches . i Have several 07 2 and 022 switches ( around 50 ) along with a lot of 072 , 054 , and 04 2 track . If somebody would be interested in this track and switches I might be willing to part with it . I do like the look of the more scale appearance tracks such as gargraves . <p> Again , please advise which rack you think would be best for Lionel post war and Legacy engines along with MTH Premier engines . If you could recommend a good source to buy a bunch of recommended track and switches I would appreciate it very much . If anybody has some of this track hand switches that are in good condition I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are going to get 50 replies &amp; 50 different opinions on this one ! Mine is to stick with tubular if you already have it . Clean it up &amp; it is ready to roll . Tubular is much easier to custom-cut specially sized sections per your specific needs , plus is quieter during operation than either of the plastic bed track systems from Lionel &amp; MTH . Most of all ... enjoy what ever you decided to do ! 175852 @qwx375852 <p> This question seems to come up almost every other month . If you are looking for opinions , the general consensus is GarGraves track and Ross switches . That combination seems to be favored by at least 50% , my personal choice as well . <p> In your case , it sounds like you have quite a stash of traditional switches . Lionel has a beautiful design and they work great , but the styles are limited . Fastrack offers a little more variety , but Ross takes the cake . I personally would n't get involved in Fastrack , it has a number of disadvantages in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GG track and Ross switches " . I have mostly GG switches , too - they seem fine , though mine are 25+ years old ( the 0-100 " standard " GG switch - very forgiving ) . So I will say GG switches and/or track - and/or Ross switches and/or track . I like the looks/spiking method of the Ross track better . Flextrack ? I do n't bend my own track a whole lot - most efforts I have seen and done are lacking in results . <p> GG is more cost-effective ; Ross is snazzier ; both are great , compatible and available . <p> But why , oh why , does neither of them offer all 3 rails blackened/darkened ? I have had to spray paint every piece of their track that i have ever bought before putting it down ! <p> " GG is more cost-effective ; Ross is snazzier ; both are great , compatible and available " I stole that directly from D500 . The Gargraves flex track and the wide array gives anyone the greatest flexibility , less hand-laying , track . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effectively . <p> I really want to stay with the Lionel tubular track because that 's what I grew up with in the fifties . Is there anyway to modify the 072 switches to make engines run over there more smoothly ? I am testing out my track with a Lionel T1 duplex engine and it is all over the place when going over the switches . Please advise . <p> As an owner and user of Scaletrax , do yourself a favor and pick something else . While it does look nice , it is not easy to put together . I have broken many a tie trying to get them together using the prescribed methods . Some pieces are not perfect so there are noticeable dips at some joins . Switches can be hit or miss and need some rework to prevent shorts or derailments . It can be delicate and flimsy . <p> I purchased mine right after the 1st Rich Batista video and got it really cheap from various online vendors . I was buying O-72 , #4 and #6 switches for $35 and $40 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even if you can find the #4 and #6 switches , they are almost double the price . <p> If I were staring over I would go with Atlas for looks or with Ross for function . <p> I also have a rather large investment in Lionel tubular track ... 031 , 054 , 072 radius curves . However for performance reasons I sold all of my Lionel 022 and 072 switches and replaced with Ross tinplate switches . All of my Lionel PW , MPC , and Modern Era engines and cars move smoothly thru these switches with no derailment problems . Certainly worth the extra cost for the switches for me . <p> I recently moved to CA from PA and moved all of my tubular track with me . After adding up the cost of a new track system , I decided to use the tubular track with Ross switches . I like the ease of installation and simply the " feel " of the old track I grew up with and very much like the reliability of the great Ross switches with DZ1000 motors . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoy the look and the extra money still in my pocket ! <p> And , FWIW , they 're both made in the U.S. of A. , and both companies run by wonderful , helpful , hobby-supporting people . Items they manufacture are always in stock . And , you may have noticed Ross ' ads in the publications , comparing their products/prices with others ( o/s manufactured ) ...... VERY interesting ! <p> They probably would n't admit it , but I 've always felt those two companies enjoy a ( word-of-the-day ) symbiotic ( **30;779;TOOLONG sense ) relationship .... meeting periodically halfway between Norwich , CT and North Rose , NY at some pub ... sampling craft brewskies in the back room ... talking ' business ' ... slapping high-fives ! <p> Note to argue with any one 's sage advice , there are a number of good options , I like both Atlas and Ross/Cargraves . But here is some nice work with Lionel Fastrack ( not my work ) . Fastrack switches are bullet-proof or nearly so , the switch motors are hidden , and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ required . 175858 @qwx375858 175852 @qwx375852 <p> The best track in my opinion is Gargraves track with Ross switches . Get stainless steel if you need to be concerned with moisture . If I was going to do my layout over I would use only Gargraves track and Ross switches . <p> Lionel Fastrack tarnishes too quickly and has electrical issues , and the switches are a few dollars more then Ross Custom switches . <p> Also track with built-in roadbed has diameter limitations , especially Fastrack ! MTH 's Realtrax and Scaletrax are duds with the switches . <p> Lee Fritz 175859 @qwx375859 <p> I may be wrong but stainless steel is not the best for Locomotive Traction for pulling long trains .

@@36015260 @5015260/ <h> inside the EMD 567 and 645 engines <p> I was reading an article about EMD engines and this question resurfaced , something I have wondered about before . <p> These EMD engines were built with exhaust passages integral to the crankcase , which pass through a water manifold also integral to the crankcase . What is the logic of this ? The cooling system gets an extra heat load , and some exhaust heat energy is removed which might otherwise have driven the turbocharger . Of course , turbochargers were a later addition to the 567 engines . <p> One theory : the 45- " vee " design of the engine cramps the space for the exhaust risers out of the cylinders in the narrow space at the top of the " vee " , so they end up sharing space with the water manifold . The engine layout requires that cylinder water jacket and exhaust both discharge from the top of the cylinder assemblies . The fabricated crankcase has a unitized configuration which fully encases the cylinder assemblies and reduces the external connections for air , exhaust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early engine designers deliberately intend to cool the exhaust to reduce the risk of fire danger from possible exhaust sparks ? <p> I 'm also wondering about the evolution of 567 engines versions A - B - C. As I recall , the A version relied on large O-rings around the cylinder assembly to seal water inlet and outlet passages from the crankcase block to the cylinder . From a mechanical design standpoint it appears to be a tidy arrangement because the cylinder assemblies slide into the block without any external manifolds to connect . In reality , the O-ring surfaces became corroded over time and it became difficult to remove and replace cylinder assemblies into the block because the O-ring sealing surfaces became rough and would damage the O-rings . So the B and C versions of 567 engine were modified to have separate " jumper " and " elbow " connections for the water inlet and outlet to each cylinder assembly . The inlet jumpers were accessed from inside the airbox ; the outlet elbows were accessed from the top deck . One of the quirks of EMD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assembly did not go external ; they could go into the airbox plenum or crankcase oil . <p> The 567A engines were considered less desirable candidates for major rebuilds compared to a 567C . The 645E engines by comparison were considerably refined for easier maintenance and better longevity , as well as increased power per cylinder . <p> Overall the EMD engines were an extremely successful design . I 'm interested to know more about the engine design characteristics and how they evolved . <p> Your typical V8 engine has the two cylinder banks at 90 degrees . Your typical V6 engine has the cylinder banks at 60 degrees . The EMD567/645/710 engines all have a 45 degree angle between the cylinder banks . This narrow angle limits the space between the cylinder banks . You probably could n't fit a 90 degree engine of similar displacement in the locomotive . Check out this link on the physics behind the angle between cylinder banks . Hopefully Rich wo n't mind me posting a link to car and driver magazine . LONG ... <p> The exhaust passages in your car/truck engine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the heat load just fine . If you think about it , the cylinders in your engine block have much more surface area than the exhaust passages and probably contribute much more heat to the cooling system . A lot of new car/truck engines actually come with the exhaust manifolds cast as part of the cylinder heads . These are essentially water cooled to an extent . <p> Not sure if you have come across this , but there is an excellent design and development summary of the EMD 567 written by Eugene Kettering and presented to the American Society of Mechanical Engineers in 1951 . It is available for download at : <p> Thanks very much Scott , that is a very interesting read with a direct and authoritative discussion of the development process through the **27;811;TOOLONG engine models . At the time of writing , the 567C was the latest development but not yet in regular production . <p> Near the end of the document is a frank admission of the trial and error process : " In closing it must always be kept in mind that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ super intelligent or analytical mind . The engine has dictated every improvement that has been made . We , at Electromotive , have only done our best to interpret what the engine was trying to tell us . " <p> As for my original question - I guess it just boils down to how the engine needed to be packaged for a rail application . The 567 engine ( and its later derivatives , the 645 and 710 models ) was a unique development of a 2-stroke diesel engine with overhead camshafts , unit injectors and a fabricated block with integral airbox and water manifolds . The block largely encased the cylinder heads to help keep the overhead camshafts under the valve covers . <p> I ca n't help but think that the exhaust passages through the water manifold probably compromised turbocharger performance to some extent , especially when the 645 and 710 engines were pushed to higher horsepower ratings in later years . A moot point I suppose , since the 710 engine has been superseded by newer 4-stroke designs . 175852 @qwx375852 <p> One item to remember about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 567 engines from EMC , they were ALWAYS mounted in an enclosed carbody such as a " Doodle Bug " , " shovel nose " , or " E Type " unit . Thus , it was pretty desirable to keep the temperatures of the top deck reasonably cool so as NOT to bake the lube oil flowing through and out of the overhead camshafts and associated valve train " jewelry " . The exhaust manifolds were hot enough as it was , so there was n't any reason to add to that terrific heat by NOT water cooling the top deck area . <p> One item to remember about the early Winton Engines , as well as the early 567 engines from EMC , they were ALWAYS mounted in an enclosed carbody such as a " Doodle Bug " , " shovel nose " , or " E Type " unit .

Lots of hot oil smell when you open them big valve covers , especially when checking things out on an idling engine . Oil pouring out of lash adjusters with sloppy clearances . Shop people would change out power assemblies and not think to change out the lash adjusters too . <p> I never saw inside a Winton engine and the ranks of 567 engines were thinning rapidly during my time . 175854 @qwx375854 175853 @qwx375853 <h> Block 175862 @qwx375862 
@@36015261 @5015261/ <h> Belts on Lionel Lumber Loader 364 and Coal Loader 397 <p> I have been reviving several vintage Lionel operating accessories before I move from a temporary to permanent layout and have some questions on belts : <p> For the 364 Lumber Loader , I purchased a new belt several years ago ( at least 5 ) from a reputable parts dealer at the TCA meet in York , but did not install it until a few weeks ago . Kept the replacement belt stored in a zip lock bag . After I installed it , the logs just slipped and could not make it up the slope . I had to put small swatches of double side clear tape periodically along the belt to provide enough friction to get the loads to hold . I know I did not install the belt wrong side out . I recently purchased another belt from Henning 's and installed it and it works fine ! Any explanation ? Any way to get the other belt to provide enough friction ? Otherwise the other belt looks fine . <p> I also revived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first with all the precautions for limiting coal jams ( closed gaps along the conveyor ) . Then all of a sudden the belt stopped moving . It seems to slip at the drive pulley , and only occasionally moves . This is the original . Should I replace it ? <p> does the belt look like it 's stretched more then normal , also there might be an adjustment you can move or slide the mechanism back enough to tighten up the belt tension and make it work correctly . can you put pictures of your problems on the forum and wel figure it out ok. glad to help you ! <p> Are you sure the 364 's belt is not slipping ? That is the common problem with the replacement belts , as soon as the weight of a log gets onto it , it starts to slip . The solution I used was to turn the belt inside out and hang it from a coat hanger wire . Spray the underside with 3M adhesive and leave dry completely . This puts a tacky surface on the business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drive pulley easier . <p> Thanks for the suggestions . I do n't think there is a tension adjustment for either accessory . For the lumber loader I think the weight of the motor puts the tension on the belt . I 'll see about the coal loader . Will try to add photos . <p> As to the main pulley on the lumber loader , that was the first problem - belt was not turning at all . Repair manual indicates there should be a strip of tacky tape on the pulley , but there was nothing there . I resolved that by putting double sided clear tape around the pulley . Belt turns on the pulley fine now , but the logs were slipping . I thought that was strange . I will try the 3M adhesive to avoid using the double sided tape . Do not know how long that will last . Might also look into a replacement pulley at a train show that 's coming up here in Portland in 2 weeks . <p> If I did this correctly , here are two short videos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is with a clean bin - belt works fine . The second is with a small amount of coal - belt begins , then stops abruptly . I also included two photos - one shows the coal itself and the other is the source - an ancient bag of American Flyer coal . I think there are two issues here : the coal pieces are too small and the belt is too old ( may have stretched a bit ) . I know the Lionel literature on this unit cautions to use only Lionel coal . May be some truth here . <p> Thanks , <p> Michael 175852 @qwx375852 <p> I am having the same problem with 397 Coal Loader . The coal that came with loader was/is ground up black plastic . The size of the pieces of plastic varied any where from tiny sliver to something near 1/8 " in diameter . After a couple of tries disassembling loader and cleaning every last bit of coal from unit I sent " Ground Up Plastic " to the garbage can . <p> I the went to local train store @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This product eliminated the problem of everything jamming up , BUT , the pieces are to big for the belt to pick up and transport up the incline . <p> My next attempt is to go to an aquarium shop and purchase some black gravel . The first store only had gravel that was even bigger than the Lionel Coal . I will keep searching as I believe this solution will work if I can find the right size . <p> I think that there might be a problem with the weight of the aquarium gravel but I have to try . I do plan on washing &amp; drying gravel to remove any small sand like pieces . <p> Yes , I do recall a thread of comments on type of coal to use on a layout and I thought the suggestion was to get aquarium gravel ... so I did . Got it from Petsmart . Be sure to get the midnight black . There is a dark blue that looks similar . See photo . So I used it on the coal loader and the video shows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at the size of the coal pieces and there is a wide range . I would think I should go through and omit the very large ( wo n't make it up the conveyor ) and very small ( will jam the unit ) . Also must be sure the coal cars can handle this size and weight . <p> Thanks for the suggestions ! <p> Michael 175852 @qwx375852 <p> I have purchased several large bags of coal from Brennan . I then took a plastic colander and drilled out the holes to give me the proper size I wanted . Then I dumped all the coal in the colander and sift out the small stuff that was getting into the 397 and leaking out of my coal car hopper doors . Has worked great . I lost about 15% due to size sorting but I use that in the bottom of fixed coal loads where it wo n't be dumped . I too changed the belt on the 397 but have been please with its performance so far . <p> Good news . I followed some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plastic colander , widened some of the holes , and screened a bag of aquarium gravel . Then I replaced the belt on the coal loader ( replaced rubber grommet along drive mechanism at same time as preventive measure ) . What a difference ! No slipping or binding at all . <p> 397 coal loader - if the coal pieces are too small , they get underneath the belt , and make the belt slip . <p> 364 lumber loader : <p> - some did have a flat spring to increase belt tension . Most just used the weight of the motor . <p> - if the belt is slipping on the motor pulley , the rollers that the belts run around may not be turning freely on their pins . remove the rollers one by one . Clean out the holes in the center of the rollers . I use pipe cleaners wet with mineral spirits . Then a drill bit that just fits ( do n't want to make the hole bigger ) , chucked in a pin vise , then another pipe cleaner , wet with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on slipping belts on 364 log loader is take a piece of 100 or so grit sandpaper ( not that critical ) and cut a piece that is the width of the black wheel and use Walthers Goo and wrap it around the wheel . No more slipping belt ! <p> Thanks for the suggestions . Re : lumber loader , I cleaned all pins , but the culprit was the poor condition of the " new " belt as well as the black pulley wheel ( logs slipped on the belt and belt slipped on the pulley ) . Replaced the belt and put double sided sticky tape on the pulley . Now all is good . May replace sticky tape with the sand paper . Good suggestion . <p> Thanks for the tip . I am actually just about done with a temporary layout . Part of this year long journey has been to revive vintage Lionel operating accessories , including the lumber loader ( now working ! ! ) . The latest plan is to showcase the latest and greatest on the layout when family ( including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then it all comes down to construct the permanent layout . This means storing items for as long as it takes . It makes sense to remove the sticky tape and go the sandpaper route on the pulley. 175854 @qwx375854 175853 @qwx375853 <h> Block 175862 @qwx375862

I was concerned about the placement of the number indicators on the 4449 &amp; 4443 with " Southern Pacific " on the tender . After a few back and forth on emails , Ryan told me the factory could move the indicators and that these two engines would therefore be correct . <p> So the 4444 and 4449 with " Southern Pacific Lines " and the American Freedom 4449 will keep the indicator numbers as posted in the catalog ( they are correct ) and you can see the 4449 is correct as it was delivered and as it is today . <p> The 4443 &amp; 4449 with " Southern Pacific " on tender will be moved to the center location as it was correct when the engine were re labeled into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And also as 4449 appeared in the 80 's and most of the 90 's . <p> Not sure why it was moved back to the front for the freedom train in 1975-1977 and the moved again in the 80 's and now back up front . I am guessing for historical reasons and the ease of reading it under steam . <p> Also the Santa Fe H16-44 will have round windows instead of square windows . As many of you know numbers 2800-2809 were delivered with round windows . 2810-2819 had square windows . Also 1n 1952 they were renumbered to 3000-3019 . I would have preferred round windows with 3000-3009 because they lasted the longest in that paint/number . But I will take what I can get . <p> That 's all I know on this topic . <p> There of course is no guarantee that they will do this or official announcement that I have seen , but I have traded emails with Ryan in the past on other projects and he has done all things he has told me . The last being changing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 8019 to 8018 &amp; 8017. 8019 was a PA3 . And also doing a first class job on the paint and getting that correct . His next promise is the Mopac SD40 's . This time the paint is supposed to be the correct blue , unlike the disappointing GP35 's . So I trusted Ryan and ordered both numbers on the SD40 's . <p> I have ordered several GS4 's and GS4 American Freedom Train and will order the SF h16-44 . <p> I have been in contact with Mike Reagan and he confirmed that the GS4s will also have correctly-sized drive rods . It does seem that Lionel is paying much more attention to detail than they had when I first started buying scale trains 7 years ago , and for that they should be commended . <p> Very nice , informative report . Here are a few " extra facts " that Lionel should be made aware of , concerning the SP GS-4 train number indicator boxes : <p> 1 ) Note that the forward mounted train number indicators are not as steep an angle as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of much different dimensions and thus " stick out " much further to show off the train number . <p> 2 ) As the name implies , the " Train Number Indicators " should carry the train number that the locomotive is assigned to handle . Only on rare occasions did the SP GS class Daylight locomotives carry an " X4444 " , for example , in the train indicators . Probably the most famous Daylight train of all , was number 98 &amp; 99 , thus the model 's Train Number Indicators should reflect either 98 or 99 , for the " Coast Daylight " passenger train . Only the Freedom Train version and today 's excursion version of 4449 should have " X4449 " carried in the train indicators . <p> WOW . These are trains that run on three rail track and are powered by electric motors . I am glad I am a toy train guy and can appreciate the great work by Ryan Kunkle . BTW Ryan , I am very thankful for your efforts and great work . <p> However , especially given Lionels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ details for Lionel to change/add that make the model even better . As T4TT mentioned above , Lionel has " started " to listen . <p> First , I am a Daylight fanatic - I have three scale Daylights imported by Max Gray , USH , and Weaver . I have a GS-2 in full Daylight dress that I scratchbuilt in 17/64 scale . I sleep . With my copy of the Church book . I paint my own . <p> But for the life of me , I can not remember which paint scheme goes with what number board placement . I can read the above , but when I turn the computer off , I just forget . <p> But the great thing is - you are paying attention to details . When you discover that missing tailbeam or those too-small cylinders , you will surpass me in awareness of details . And you will force these die cast folks to go the extra distance to produce truly scale models . <p> I do hope Lionel will make the correct rods for the FEF - I am tired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the foundry . I never did do a really good set for the FEF or Challenger . <p> But for the life of me , I can not remember which paint scheme goes with what number board placement . I can read the above , but when I turn the computer off , I just forget . <p> If you ever forget , you can Google " Southern Pacific 4449 photos " and look at the dozens of photographs that are there . The crew keeps it authentic . Periodically they have changed the lettering scheme on the tender , and when the tender is painted with the small " Southern Pacific Lines , " the number boards on the engine are in the front . When they have the tender painted with the large " Southern Pacific " lettering , the number boards are in the middle of the engine . So you can just look at the pictures to refresh your memory . <p> But the point is , I do not carry all those photos with me when I am viewing my models . In fact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my models just sitting here . I do care about those other things I mentioned above . To each his own , right ? <p> First , I am a Daylight fanatic - I have three scale Daylights imported by Max Gray , USH , and Weaver . I have a GS-2 in full Daylight dress that I scratchbuilt in 17/64 scale . I sleep . With my copy of the Church book . I paint my own . <p> But for the life of me , I can not remember which paint scheme goes with what number board placement . I can read the above , but when I turn the computer off , I just forget . <p> Now Bob , that statement is pretty hard for me to believe . As highly intelligent as you are , with a memory like a steel trap for everything O Scale , and a former Airline Pilot , you mean to say that you ca n't remember how the train number indicators are placed on SP GS class locomotives ? <p> Hot , interesting info about the number boards having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand the concern about committing to buying a model if the catalog is incorrect but in this case Lionel has got it right on their previous models with number board placement correct for the lettering era . FWIW the moving of the number boards occurred before the lettering was changed by a few years so Small SP Lines along with rearward located number boards would also be OK ...... sort of , as this change was made during WWII when most if not all of the engines were painted black . <p> I am truly delighted that this sort of thing catches the interest of 3-railers . It is selfish , because it forces the importers to look harder at accuracy , which then filters down to things that I care about - overall shape , aspect ratios , cylinder size , and yes , side rods . <p> When things like number board placement bother me , I simply move them and stop worrying . But so far , the number boards on a GS- class have been extremely low on my list . I did re-driver my Max @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pattern . It got Overland drivers and NWSL/Pittman power , and now is like a Swiss watch . <p> My Weaver is inaccurate - it is a GS-3 with a GS-4 tender . I just added a fireman 's porch and happily pressed on . I may someday get rid of that screwhead holding the rear ladder on . I did do all the 2-rail machining on it . <p> Was it approximately right after WWII , 1946 or so , when all the lettering on the Daylight GS tenders was changed from " Southern Pacific Lines " to the large " Southern Pacific " lettering ? <p> Yes . The SP began the change to just " SOUTHERN PACIFIC " in 1946 , and surprisingly completed the " change over " fairly quickly , i.e. less than 2 years . <p> The relocation , and mounting angle of the Train Number Indicators was started about 1942/1943 . <p> Thanks , Hot Water . I am going to get one of these GS-4s , and have some Lionel 18 " streamlined pass . cars waiting . Would it be correct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Southern Pacific " tender lettering would be more prototypical to use with the streamlined cars ? <p> Since the SP received their first " streamlined " passenger cars in 1937 , I believe , it pretty much depends on which era you desire to model . Daylight streamlined passenger cars , with fluted sides and " Souther Pacific Lines " lettering from 1937 through 1946 , or passenger cars with fluted sides and the " SOUTHERN PACIFIC " lettering after 1946 through the early 1950s , or lastly , passenger cars with smooth sides powered by either steam or diesel , from the early 1950s forward . <p> There 's another discrepancy with the Lionel GS-4 besides the number board placement which no one else seemed to notice . <p> The connecting rods , just like in Lionel 's original release of this model , are wrong . <p> The rods they used on their GS-4 are the same ones they used on the scale GS2 &amp; GS6 which predated Lionel 's scale GS-4 in the market . What the GS2 and GS6 used was a narrower , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( and the GS 5 ) had heavier , " beefier " rods . Probably did this as a cost-cutting measure , or they did n't check against the prototype . <p> Here 's a couple of pictures that show the differences : <p> GS-2 connecting rod <p> GS-4/5 connecting rod <p> Lionel , to the best of my knowledge is the only importer out of the likes of Sunset/3rd Rail , Weaver , Williams ( brass ) &amp; MTH that got this detail wrong on O scale versions of the GS-4 . It 's enough of a detraction to me that I originally passed on their first release , and unless Lionel corrects this on the latest catalog offering , I 'm inclined to pass on that one too . <p> Now THAT would be a GREAT idea ! I would changeout the main rods on my Legacy GS-4 in a heartbeat . <p> I 'm frankly surprised , given your identical fickleness for prototype accuracy as I am , to have been willing overlook that detail by buying the first release . <p> I certainly did NOT overlook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gift-horse in the mouth for free model . My real dilemma has been , from the day I received it , that " Southern Pacific Lines " lettering on the tender . Since I still have a number of the special Champ Decal sets for SP Daylight steam locomotives , simply having my custom painter buddy correct the lettering to the large SOUTHERN PACIFIC , still leaves the incorrect location of the Train Order Indicators . <p> Since the SP received their first " streamlined " passenger cars in 1937 , I believe , it pretty much depends on which era you desire to model . Daylight streamlined passenger cars , with fluted sides and " Southern Pacific Lines " lettering from 1937 through 1946 , or passenger cars with fluted sides and the " SOUTHERN PACIFIC " lettering after 1946 through the early 1950s , or lastly , passenger cars with smooth sides powered by either steam or diesel , from the early 1950s forward . <p> Thanks for this information . Since the Lionel 18 " aluminum Daylight cars have fluted sides and " Southern Pacific Lines " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1937-1946 , and the engine tender should have the " Southern Pacific Lines " lettering as well ( assuming prototypical operation matters , which is the direction I lean ) . <p> In any case , it seems appropriate for this train that the lettering on the engine/tender should match that on the cars , where there was such a clear effort by the railroad to maintain proper decorum of these top-of-the-line trains . <p> It appears the new plastic 21 " Daylight cars are the same type of cars , fluted with the " Southern Pacific Lines " lettering . <p> By 1949 the Daylight cars were sent everywhere . I saw them in the Golden State , along with red and silver Golden Rocket cars and green heavyweight Pullmans , usually pulled by a pair of GS-class locomotives , on the old El Paso and Southwestern route . By that time , perhaps they stopped paying much attention to what was painted how and when . I believe the only thing that remained pure was the Sunset - all Budd cars , and it went through at midnight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tornado coming to kill me . <p> I bet you could find the same thing in the San Joaquin Valley , after they pulled steam out of Arizona in 1951 - but by then the skirts had come off all the GS class . <p> With some imagination , you can get away with a lot - even five foot gauge . <p> Give us a link ? I can not post photos anymore , either . I ca n't even edit - well , I can , but the " Post " button just stares at me . I am ok with that ; you have seen all my photos , including the scratchbuilt GS-2 , on multiple occasions . 175854 @qwx375854 175853 @qwx375853 <h> Block 175862 @qwx375862

I think there would be enough in the steam era alone to chew on , let alone digest , for a while ..... <p> I 'm thinking that is a good suggestion to narrow the scope . Really , I know my interest and passion is in the steam era , and in that sense it might be best to end it right there in 1960 . <p> I feel badly that I let these guys do research and contribute to the thread as they 've done and not include their work in some manner . It is included in the heart of the thread automatically I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to feel unappreciated and I want them to contribute in the future . I 'm thinking the best way to handle it would be to move the diesel era sections of the list into their own section for reference . <p> Just a suggestion : I thought this thread was coming along quiet well and quickly . After all the work that everyone has done and turn it around and chop it off in 1960 . Then I suggest chop off this thread and go off line with it . Anyone interested can email you direct instead of popping this thread to the top of the forum , since you will just will be limiting/narrowing the interest to a fewer number of people .

And if you decide not to take on the diesel section , I hope you will come back and contribute for the steam items . <p> You might consider a format something like what I have done with the O Scale Freight Car Guide . Use one thread as a hub with links to other threads with information on each particular car or locomotive type . <p> While I am not an N&amp;W modeler I have become quite familiar with finding things on the Atlas , Lionel and MTH web sites .

Yes I appreciate what you 've done and absolutely welcome any input in the future from you or anyone . At least for now I want to stick with the 1960 break . Any images you or anyone can get from the importers would be appreciated and I 'll gladly work them in .

I want anyone to contribute at any time but I do n't want to put any pressure on anyone to make this thread move too quickly , including myself .

Well , of course the lettering did not fit correctly , so I decided to take the stake pockets off and arrange them better . While I was doing that , I realized the stake pockets on the car were not really close to the prototype so I decided to get some from Grant Line which are closer to the prototype and I put them on instead . In that process I figured I might as well cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car to make the car the proper length .

@@36015265 @5015265/ 175852 @qwx375852 <p> Thanks Don . Great comparison photos . The K-Line model seems to have a bit more detail than the Williams and Lionel versions . I have been looking at some on Ebay and notice the third rail shoes are molded into the truck sides on the K-line model . It also has the small pantograph detail on the roof . I never understood what this little pantograph was for . One thing I did notice is the main pantographs is the contact shoe . It looks wimpy next to the Williams and Lionel pantograph shoes . I plan on running my locos under a catenary system and I wonder if the K-Line pantograph shoe is capable of that . <p> Dan Padova <p> " In the course of my life I have had to eat my words , and I must confess it was a wholesome diet " .......... Winston Churchill <p> The K-line engine is really a beautiful model and often it is very reasonably priced . The truck mounted shoes do interfere with some track work and close clearance bridges . I ran mine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MTH truss bridge that I have never had any problems with . <p> The small Pantagraphs were for running in GCT the track was so complex that the third raid is eliminated in some areas . If you look at the NYC S motors they had them too . <p> If I remember right , those third rail shoes you mentioned on the K-Line version did n't play nice with Ross switches . They would hit something on the switch ( the switch machine perhaps ? ) and either cause a derailment or stop the train or something . <p> The zinc problem was effectively eliminated in Western industrialized nations decades ago ; in the young , inexperienced and , ah , less " conscientious " industrialized nations of the Pacific Rim and the Indian Ocean ( China , India , even Japan ) , the problem re-appeared here when the items showed up . <p> I seen a few K-Line version with broken pilots so check it out carefully before buying . If your buying in ebay ask questions and save the e mails so you can have then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a MTH Premiere which is a little longer than the williams version and MTH also made a shortened Rail King version . <p> I have the K-Line NH EP-5 #379 ( the version with TMCC and cruise ) . These are scale engines , and very nice . It 's been said that they 're probably the best EPs made to date . Some operators have reported some problems with the old K-Line cruise control , though , and changed over to ERR cruise with great results . <p> The main downside to the engines is that some of them had the brittle metal on some parts ( the zinc rot , presumably ) as mentioned previously . Most of the damage which I 've seen ( in two of them ) and heard about from others , has been in the pilots , like Gene mentioned above , and they would break into pieces . Also , some very small decorative extensions on the trucks would break off . <p> Those little extension portions are n't any big deal , and to take care of the pilots I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up so far , but I 'm careful with them . The breakage would occur in an area of the pilot that is has very thin extensions - probably accurate , but it might have helped if some accuracy had been sacrificed for the sake of robustness . Even that might not have helped offset the rot , though . <p> Glad to hear Jeff 's ( Captaincog ) report about the truck side frames , and how they can be replaced with Lionel versions , should that problem arise with my EP . After Lionel took over K-Line for a while back a number of years ago , they produced some more EP-5s under the K-Line by Lionel name , including a Great Northern version . It may be that the zinc rot problem was corrected by that time . I have n't checked to see if replacement parts like truck frames and pilots are available from Lionel for these , which presumably would fit the earlier K-Line models . <p> Mayday Mayday ! I have a New Haven EP-5 unit ( #379 version with TMCC and Cruise ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cog , can you post info on what you did as I do n't believe there are any replacements available . It is a beautiful engine that ca n't be missing them . Thanks in advance . <p> Some K-Line engines(EP-5 's and GG-1 's ) and passenger cars ( heavy weight series , 3 axle trucks ) suffered very much from " zinc pest " as the foreign countries did n't filter their zinc properly or were too cheap to care . <p> You might be able to modify a Lionel part to use with the K-Line engine . <p> Do n't know about the Williams EP-5 but the Williams engines I have all run very well . Only problem is that when you buy the Williams engine or passenger cars they now belong to you for life ( nobody wants to buy a Williams ) , at least that is my experience here in southeast Florida . <p> Lee Fritz 175859 @qwx375859 175854 @qwx375854 175853 @qwx375853 <h> Block 175862 @qwx375862

I 'm not real familiar with either one of them so those of you who use them can tell me how they are working out for you . I have used the ZW-C at a couple of friends homes on their layouts . I plan on looking for a ZW-C at York in October , but if I do n't find one , the z4000 or the MRC are my back up plan . The ZW-L cost way too much to even consider 175852 @qwx375852 <p> I have a three Z-4000 's and a ZW-C with 4 bricks . I strongly prefer the Z-4000 for many reasons , especially the voltage and amperage readouts . I find the breakers on the ZW are a little too sensitive and I 've never had an electronics failure due to the slightly delayed tripping of the Z-4000 breakers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had some issues with MRC transformers running conventional locomotives , especially those with QSI electronics . You 're mileage may vary . <p> MTH specifically recommended against the MRC for DCS when I was at the ASC training a few years ago . I was a bit surprised as it 's a pretty generic transformer , but they claimed there were operational issues at times . <p> Picking a Transformer is definitely a individual Engineering opinion , Guns and I have bantered back and forth about Brick type Transformers for many years . He likes the bricks , I probably will never own one . Both type of Transformers get the job done quite well , each in a little different way . <p> I highly recommend a Z4K , in fact more than one . <p> PCRR/Dave 175857 @qwx375857 <p> FWIW John , I ca n't really understand why the MRC would affect DCS . I had the MRC Pure Power Dual 270 , and I took it apart to see what was in there . A large toroid transformer with dual wipers and a sea of diodes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how that affects DCS . <p> I think it has been a long time since any of the magazines did a transformer article . Would make for a good update ! <p> I think the MRC Dual is the most economical of the bunch and that is why I purchased one several years ago for my layout . I do like the dual amp/volt gauges . I bought a second MRC to power an expansion of my conventional layout , but since I am moving to Legacy have decided to keep it as a spare . <p> Jim <p> Historic Frederick County , Maryland . Modeling both the Reading and B&amp;O Railroads . <p> I have been wondering for along time why the MRC Dual is not on the MTH DCS Transformer list . I was told long ago that it 's not the DCS TIU , but something about the P1 engines and some of the P2 engines that is the problem when using the MRC , however whether this is actually true I have no idea . <p> PCRR/Dave 175857 @qwx375857 <p> I do n't understand MTH not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supposed to be a good pure sine wave transformer ?

I measure very carefully , maybe twice and then cut to fit if I have to . I go with the recommendations for wiring taken from the NEC code book for wire sizes . <p> Even when doing track placement it can be placing it to fit . Adjusting the track clearance when seeing if 2 engines or 2 passenger cars can go through parallel curve tracks . <p> Lee Fritz 175859 @qwx375859 <p> Some of the things that come up for me daily are very similar to what we do in this hobby ? How much can I get out of a sheet of plywood ? Cut maps , cut lists . The geometry of angles and how to make sure things fit together seamlessly . How much do I order with a small safety margin without blowing the budget or creating a storage problem ? If I am hanging something from the ceiling how much weight can I hang safely using the least and thinnest lines . How quickly can I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is always amazingly different ) ? When I need things how can I order to get them in time and so we do n't run out . Fun stuff that I deal with daily . <p> The opposite also applies to convert a dimension scaled off of a model into 1:1 sizes . <p> I use this functionality all the time to convert prototype dimensions to scale sizes so that I can seek out appropriately sized styrene sheets and shapes . I can also use it to scale dimensions off an HO model and convert them to O scale . <p> try this scale converter Anything smaller than 1/4 " ( .25 ) is too small to worry about . A 1/4 " 1:1 is really too small in 1:48. 6 " 1:48 scale is slightly larger than an 1/8 " 1:1 . <p> Do you work at a lower accuracy ? 1/16 " 1:1 is close to 3 " 1:48 That 's about as small as I would want to work . <p> 6 " at 1:48 is actually exactly 1/8 " at 1:1 . And 3 " at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is rounding up to only two decimal places . <p> One of the nice things about O scale is that it converts conveniently into scale dimensions that we are all pretty comfortable with already .... unless one prefers metric ! It also helps somewhat that 1/4 " = 1 ' -0 " is a very common drafting scale , so things like building plans and sizes can be very easy to relate to . <p> Now does the line have some sort of PTC which is on line ? ATS ? Passing siding ? If they meet , it would more than likely be at speed , so onew would have a " Corn Field " meet . And there was no location for each train at the start of the verbal proplem ? <p> Phillyreading/Lee : I know what you mean about those clearances . I 'll never forget feeling so clever to see my two engines and their consists running side-by-side for the first time until they rounded a corner and some cars lightly grazed one another . Serves me right for not doing a manual dry-run first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ list of uses for math in your job ! It goes well beyond the obvious to include things like weight for hanging and time management , but it is so true . Although I am a " technical " writer and work with physics PhDs , I never use math for my job ( stuff like COBOL , maybe , and a hint of logic/decision flow here or there ... but no math : - ) . <p> Rattler21/John : Unfortunately , my elementary school stopped using slide rules when I got to whatever grade it was that normally introduced them . So my brother got one the year prior and as a result I always though they were mysterious and cool and only used for square roots . I 'll see if there 's still one in the family somewhere . It would be fun to finally master it . <p> Moonman : Your link to an online converter is exactly the sort of tool that I was looking for . Thanks ! It will come in very handy and save me from writing a program . And how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my layout is carpet-based and must be moved and my budget modest , I have looser standards for accuracy than I might otherwise like but I get your point about how some precision is meaningless at certain sizes . What has always interested me , ' though , and which is somewhat related are the decisions that model makers make to step outside of a literal interpretation of the scale . It reminds me of being a charicaturist some years ago . I had to make an active decision as to what facial features to accentuate and what spaces to show or play around to create an impression that is identifiable as a person . It 's the same thing with a drawing that will be mechanically reduced without loss of recognition -- say for publication . You need to accentuate somethings and downplay others to have the end result be recognizable at a given percentage . You can see this in Matchbox cars in particular . Somethings are a little out of scale to make them look like they are in scale . I just bought an N scale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wack , but it looks appropriate at the smaller scale because of what it suggests to our eyes . I find that I also adjust for color when working smaller -- usually toning the value down considerably . So , instead of black , I might use gray for example . I wonder if you make these sorts of scale and color decisions or compromises for your wonderful dioramas , too . Thanks for the tips . <p> big train : Thanks for the basic formulas for when I 'm too lazy to log in to a computer ( which is most of the time after 8-hours in front of one ) . And an excellent observation about the converter rounding up and hiding the underlying and easier to manage correlations to inches . It is good to know that 1/4 ' = 1 ' -0 " is a common drafting scale should I ever get so inspired as to scratch build a ( cardboard ) building . <p> You are right . Building a layout is nothing but a long series of those dreaded " word problems " from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I am doing fractions in my head constantly ... If I need 2 3/4 on the outside of the curve , and I have 5 5/16 to work with , then the center needs to be how far from the other side ? Ok , so the least common denominator is ... <p> There are lots of occasions to use basic geometry : how long a train can be turned on this reverse loop ? Let 's see , C= D*Pi ... I want to cut a corner brace for the bench work ... how long to make it ? Well , a2+b2=c2 , so ... They taught us in school how to find square roots ; I wish I 'd learned that better . I hate stopping what I 'm doing and fumbling around for a calculator ... I 've already got a pencil in hand ! <p> I have many times wished that I 'd worked harder in Trig class in high school . For example , building a control panel : I know the size of the panel , and how tall the back of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sides ? No clue .... I built a section that swings out : If the section is 33 inches wide , and 9 inches deep , then how much clearance will I need so the rear corner does not hit the frame when I try to open it ? Umm , I guess I can build a mock-up out of cardboard first ... This is a 3.5% grade , and I want to make some supports for it . What angle do I set the crosscut fence on my table saw ? Maybe I 'll cut them long , so I can keep trying different angles till I find the right one ... <p> And we used to complain that we would never use this stuff for anything ! if any of our young members who are still in school are reading this , please , do yourselves a favor and learn your math ! ! ! <p> when will they meet ?

@@36015283 @5015283/ <h> Williams Brass K4 and some upgrades <p> I just recently bought a ( I think ) first issue Williams Brass PRR K4 and thought I might post some about it here . First off , it was suppose to be DOA , but I felt the price was right ( $139 + shipping ) to make this happen . I know about the old Reverse boards in these giving up the ghost and figured that was probably the case and that I could either fix or replace anything needed to make it go again . Needless to say I tend to buy a lot of projects ... <p> Anyway , here 's a couple of pictures of it to start with . <p> First from the auction : <p> And now on my layout running fine after a bit of work and tweaking . <p> Dennis Holler If its old and broke , I like it 175852 @qwx375852 <p> So it turns out that it was n't quite DOA because it did run for me , but it did end up running and sequencing inconsistently . I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but at the same time I did n't really feel like messing with it when 1 ) I plan to upgrade this engine later to a Cruise Commander and 2 ) I had a trusty mechanical E-unit ready to go . <p> So here is the original reverse board in the tender . <p> And here is the " backdate " to an American Flyer three position E unit with a nice little rectifier installed . I had actually used this E-unit is an MTH Railking K4 that also had a failed QSI board . <p> So , if nothing else , this just goes to show that it can be done , and it will work although this type of install is seldom if ever mentioned . For me it 's a no brainer since I have plenty of parts and this engine was " broken " anyway . This is my " get her running " trick . <p> PS , I forgot to mention , notice how this install also uses the same factory Williams harness to connect with the engine . Again , the immediate goal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... Task completed 175852 @qwx375852 <p> So , now that it runs , Let 's consider some updates , or shall we say some items I would like to correct . <p> Start with Electronics : <p> 1 ) Cruise Commander ... No CC Lite here <p> 2 ) MTH fan driven smoke unit as the Seuth was DOA , and was worthless anyway . <p> 3 ) Super Chuffer . I 'm really interested in this little bugger , so It is on the list for sure . <p> 4 ) Some form of Railsounds possibly .... This may even be optional ... we 'll see . <p> 5 ) maybe an electrocoupler- this should go well with 1 &amp; 3 . <p> 6 ) This may be out there , but I would like to put Whistle smoke on this engine too . <p> Geez ... That 's a lot of stuff ! <p> Now for the mechanical changes I would like to make . <p> Keep in mind this loco as built was a Williams three rail version and as such is lacking in detail and has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lead truck is rather elongated and in my opinion is installed with a pretty poor swing geometry compared to current designs on similar engines . <p> Simply put , with my very rough measurements , the lead truck wheelbase is 3/8 " too long , the lead truck CL is 1/8 " forward of where it should be , the pilot beam is in the neighborhood of 3/8 's + longer than it should be and of course as others have mentioned the boiler is about 1/8 " to long . <p> Now , I 'm not sure if I really want to cut the boiler up , but I definitely want to do something about some of those dimensions of the lead truck and front main frame . <p> So we 'll start with <p> 1 ) New lead truck frame with similar install geometry to the Lionel/Kline K-4 and a shorter more prototypical wheel base . <p> 2 ) 36 " dia lead wheels , with more scale flanges . <p> 3 ) from there would like to experiment with moving the cylinders back that 1/8 " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work with 36 " scale wheels . <p> 4 ) move the pilot beam back closer to where it ought to be based on the success of the steps above . <p> 5 ) Consider shortening the boiler only if 3 shows good merit , otherwise no reason to mess with it . <p> 6 ) Correct the flanges on drivers and trailing truck as well . <p> 7 ) Add details and repaint . <p> So there are a bunch of things I 'd like to do with this engine that I think would help make look more prototypical and I 'll try to make some progress and post the results here . I think thee is a lot of good with this , in rebuilding " cheap " Williams brass into something hopefully good looking and then adding the good smoke and controls as well . <p> Below is a great shot comparing the lead trucks and pilot of three different " scale " K4 's ... <p> You can really see that difference in lead truck length on the Williams engine . Honestly , this is probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get one of these engine 's for a long time . <p> From here , I 'm going to make a new lead truck frame with a shorter wheel base and will post back here those results and we 'll see where this go 's . <p> Dennis , I just acquired the same Williams K4 . Mine has a few issues and I 'm wondering if you can help . <p> First , the pilot 's clearance is very close--so close that it scrapes the rails and hits the guard-rails on my switches .

I contacted Williams but they have no parts left for this and they wo n't warranty anything . I have the original paperwork from this loco , purchased in 1986 , and at that time it only came with a 90-day warranty . As a temporary fix for the eccentric crank issue , I removed the eccentric rod . It does n't look great , but it will at least run until I can find a fix for that--provided I can figure out the pilot issue . <p> Maybe post a pic of your loco and the pilot . I have two of these now , bought one for $139 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . As of yet , I have not made any updates on my locos , but as others have said , they seem to run great and I would think they would be great for some electronic updates . <p> Maybe post a pic of your loco and the pilot .

As of yet , I have not made any updates on my locos , but as others have said , they seem to run great and I would think they would be great for some electronic updates . 175852 @qwx375852 <p> There was no lifetime warranty on the Samhongsa Brass engines . The lifetime warranty came after Williams lost the contract with Samhongsa Brass due to the Williams Brass blowout of 1991 . Then their sales started to decline due to many hobbieist feeling burned by the sale from the Mfg/ importer . <p> Precision Scale Company sells lots of detail parts for locos including valve gear items . You can also find O scale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find an eccentric crank that will work one of those places . <p> And Williams brass steam - well-made and usually inexpensive - I have to stay away from them . Their USRA Heavy Pacific ( imperfect version , but not bad ) - I have trouble not buying them . Same mechanicals as the K4s , I would think . Do n't have a K4s to compare . <p> The big flanges on these locos - I paint the shiny wheels black or weathered black anyway ( masking the actual running tire face ) and let the track wear away what it needs to on the flanges - usually a thin strip and the big flange tends to fade away in the dark . <p> Front truck wheelbase - yeah - for 031 , etc , track . I have 072 , so that WB could be shortened . <p> Not being much of a historian , did William 's utilize anything from earlier brass offerings by companies like Max Gray , All Nation , etc ? The level of detail on that William 's K4 looks identical to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sand dome access steps and period correct mods , etc . The front end configuration is n't quite right on the William 's example , with the TC box moved to the right running board when outfitted with a sheet metal pilot .... the smoke box front platform , and change int class light design . As usual , the folks at Sunset got it right . <p> As I understand the Williams brass locomotives were all new tooling at the time . Korean factories can fabricate everything very efficiently out of brass and they do it very well whether it is all brass construction or the various castings required . However , someone can correct me , I believe that some of the early Weaver brass locomotives are the same tooling as the Williams versions . <p> The Sunset model I posted is off a little . It is the High Iron series from 2004 . The front porch is too long and the pony truck slightly longer to accommodate 3R flanges . However with the correct 36 " wheels on the front , it is not quite as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ones I 've seen . At $1k used , another $300 for a better working drive , and having to paint it that is out of my reach for some time . <p> Detail of the Sunset lead truck . <p> Regardless , the Williams model still looks pretty good coming around the curve . <p> Well shoot ... was thinking of thinning the herd , but I really like my Williams one too . : - ) <p> Jonathan Peiffer <p> Modeling the NY&amp;LB in Arizona <p> TCA Member 01-53047 <p> PRRT&amp;HS Member 8880 <p> SFRHMS Member 6739 <p> Paradise &amp; Pacific Railroad Member <p> Friendly Rivet Counter 175852 @qwx375852 <p> Precision Scale Company sells lots of detail parts for locos including valve gear items .

@@36015294 @5015294/ <h> FasTrack Door Layout - figure eight with return and passing O-31 FT <p> I needed to update SCARM to 9.32 so I was just messing around . I am rebuilding my layout and was thinking about making a door layout . I do n't have any of the Fastrack O-31 so I was just looking to see what it would look like on a standard 36 x 80 door . Here is my result . It has four of the 1 &amp; 3/8 and another four of the 1 &amp; 3/4 and it also needed some three-quarter O-31 curves which I only found the one-quarter so I needed twelve of those . For those that do n't know , in Fastrack world , 20 of those specialty pieces means expensive ! But that is what makes SCARM fun , the chance to experiment . 175852 @qwx375852 <p> Yes , I will second Carl 's idea of renaming the thread title so that it is more easily found when doing a search . <p> In the past , there have been some threads on door sized layouts with tubular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sized layouts are understandably limited , they offer a world a possibilities to those who do not having the living space for a larger layout ...

Again , renaming the post would be very useful to others seeking some ideas and inspiration . <p> Carl , I realized after I posted that I had forgotten to account for the quarter curve with the switch , I also forgot that I had two more of the curves as well . In any case if I were to build this I would likely just cut a full curve in half to get the 2 quarter curve sections . The " top / bottom " straights I would also likely cut and convert to an isolated outer rail to activate lights ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 45 degree came with additional pieces . It 's funny the more I type and think about it , the more likely it seems I might just build it . I have to say I also appreciate your planning work as well . I know I have many of your scarm files saved into my folder myself . <p> Brianel , I believe the main reason you have n't seen any FasTrack door layouts is due to the fact that until Lionel just came out with the O-31 curve the O-36 would n't fit onto a 36 inch wide door . I had a 4 by 8 foot O-36 layout for years with the more traditional 90 degree figure 8 with siding just like I drew up here . It 's likely why I went to my old standby when I was practicing with some of the new scarm features . 175854 @qwx375854 175853 @qwx375853 <h> Block 175862 @qwx375862

@@36015296 @5015296/ <h> O27 Tubular and a Hollow Wood Door Fun <p> I 've had a hollow wood door sitting in my basement for a couple years now , always thinking I should " do something " with it , so I decided to create a O27 tubular " quick and dirty " layout on it this weekend . <p> The door is around 30 " by 72 " , and I wanted to try to squeeze in as much as I could so I decided on one big oval and a figure eight squeezed in the middle . <p> Picture 1 : <p> I stapled down some cheap green felt and began laying the track , picture 2 : <p> Note I 'm using ties which I picked up yesterday at my LHS , Star Hobby , picture 3 : <p> ( yes , they were &lt;$12 , the guy at Star Hobby said " they have been here a long time , look at the dust on the bag !

I 'll have to make sure I run the trains slow <p> - I added a street circle too , which was fun <p> - I need to clean up the wiring a bit <p> - I wish I had stained or painted the ties , but I wanted to get something done quickly <p> - I had the track sitting in a box <p> - My helper was super excited when we were done , can you tell from the picture ? <p> Yep , lots of fun in a small space . Looks like y'all got it figured out . My O27 layout is also tubular on a hollow core door , 36x80 with strips added on the long edges to make it 39 " wide . Gives more room between loops . Similar track plan , but inner figure 8 has switches to allow you to run it as an oval . <p> Keep up the good work ! <p> Andy <p> When they were passing out brains , I thought they said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Good job , Rich . I did a similar project with my now-22-year-old son when he was about 6 . Our design was similar , but was one oval with four switches that allowed us to have a figure 8 &amp; at a 90-degree crossing in the middle . It has always been handy to get out &amp;/or put back away , either under a bed , or just leaning against the basement wall . I 've got no one to use it with now , but it is still here ..... waiting . Enjoy your time with your daughter to the fullest .... she will be asking for the car keys before you know it ! <p> My first 3-rail O-gauge layout , to run my dad 's old Lionel train , was a figure-8 on a 30 " x 79 " door . The O27 curves have O54 easements and it has a custom-built 67.5-degree crossing to make it fit the space . This layout is still set up and has evolved into a reasonably " complete " toy-train layout , but only the track and road are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's fun ! <p> I have a temporary O27 loop-to-loop layout on another 30 " x 79 " door . I spliced cut-down O22 switches into the O27 track because they have better non-derailing action than O27 switches . This is a fun little layout because the train has an automatic " random route " feature through the central junction . The layout space is filled out with some GeoTrax and misc stuff . Nothing is fastened down because I like the flexibility of changing things around sometimes . <p> An O27 layout on a door-table is a good way to have 3-rail fun in a really limited space . <p> In this case , at no point does straight track join directly into an O27 curve section . A wider O54 curve joins straight sections to O27 curves . Trains run better , look better IMO . In a figure-8 configuration the wider easement curve does not require additional table width . Following version uses all standard track pieces with no cutting . Wider O42 , O54 , etc curves are available in O27 profile track . <p> Real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curves . For model railroad purposes with sectional track , this type of arrangement works well enough . <p> Hollow-core doors make a convenient lightweight platform for small portable layouts , and also have good potential for use in modular layout construction . <p> You mean there are TWO of us around here working with O27 out of Star Hobby ? ! <p> All of a sudden I do n't feel so alone anymore . <p> Hi Pat , yes , Star Hobby would be my LHS , I 'm north of them by about 20 minutes or so , visited quite often over the last few years while I worked in Annapolis , but I 'm not working in Columbia so I have n't been there in a couple months . Maybe I 'll make a stop next weekend . <p> Thank you all for the other comments/etc .

I was going to suggest that you start annexing space in the basement for a bigger layout using this as a starting point .

It will run these locos , so the source of the problem is not the transformer . <p> Start with the 282 . Remove the boiler shell . Oil the drive wheel axles and shoot some WD-40 into the cylinder holding the smoke piston .

The 1953 version has a 5 wire connection between the engine and tender , the 5th wire is soldered to the connector that plugs into the back of the engine which makes it more complicated to swap tenders . The factory service manual shows all 282 's with a 5 wire connection as well , but I think some were made with 4 wires . all the engines use the 4 position reverse unit .

Pay attention to the brushes and commutator in the motors and be sure to remove hardened grease from the gears . Take the E-Units apart and clean the drums and contacts . <p> I re watched Tom Barker 's video as Craig suggested . It is well done and helpful for anyone who does not routinely do these repairs . His books and videos are invaluable . It might seem intimidating at first but the most common things are not .

Other brands are available at supply stores . This can be used to clean the wheels , contacts and commutator .

They can break but it is uncommon . The more common problem is one or more of the wires break where they are soldered to the plug pins at the engine connector or at the fingers on the fibre strips in the tender .

Does the boiler come off or do I need to take off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the 302 ( the only one with wire handrails ) has a boiler front that comes off revealing the headlight . If yours actually is marked 302AC I assume it is one of the later versions with either a 1-piece die cast or plastic boiler . On those versions there is a small metal bracket that holds the headlamp . It is affixed to the underside of the pilot ( " cowcatcher " ) with a single screw . You should be able to access the bulb by simply removing that single screw . <p> The following link shows a crude diagram of the 1-piece 302 . The small bulb bracket is item 4 in the diagram . In reality , it will be connected to wiring for the bulb ( not shown ) , but you should still be able to wiggle it out after removing the screw . <p> The link Craig provided is to an excellent AF resource site . I recommend you scan through some of the other material on that site . <p> If the headlight still does not work with a replacement bulb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is slightly short . I got quite a few of those from suppliers . The fix I use is to clip off a very short piece of solid conductor wire ( 1/16 " ) and drop it on the center conductor in the socket . Screw in the bulb , it will hold the wire in place and complete the connection . I have several engines running with this fix . I hope you do not have this problem . <p> I got the 282 running , my son and I worked on it last night . The problem now is I no longer am receiving track power so the headlight and smoke unit are not working and the locomotive only goes in reverse now . When I put the switch on the tender to go forward it just hums . I think it is because it does n't know the words . <p> You seem to have a wiring problem to the headlight and smoke unit . Check the wiring to the motor brushes , as this is where they get their power from . <p> The reverse only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tender . The finger contacts and drum of the reverse unit need to be checked to see that they are not worn , dirty , bent or burned through . <p> I got the 282 running , my son and I worked on it last night . The problem now is I no longer am receiving track power so the headlight and smoke unit are not working and the locomotive only goes in reverse now . When I put the switch on the tender to go forward it just hums . I think it is because it does n't know the words . <p> Two steps forwards and one step back . <p> We will need to get a volt meter and do some testing . <p> Any suggestions ? <p> Thanks for your time , Ron . <p> It 's important to note that the 5-wire locomotives ( typical for the 282 ) connect their " 5th wire " directly to the rivet on the fiber panel that screws to the back of the locomotive cab . That wire is the one that keeps power to the headlamp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the removable jack panel . I think it is indicated by the green wire in the diagram that TrainLarry provided . If you changed around any wiring or disconnected that wire that 's soldered directly to the rivet you may have caused the loss of power to the smoke/light . <p> You mentioned that the 282 goes only in reverse . Can you rear the reverse unit cycle ( " click " ) at all when the switch under the tender is in either position ? It sounds like the reverse drum is not rotating , but it 's hard to tell without seeing the locomotive operate in person . The first few minutes of the Tom Barker video posted above will give you an idea of what I mean when I ask if you can hear the reverse unit cycle/click . <p> As suggested , Tom Barker 's video should be helpful . Keep in mind the lever under the tender is simply a mechanical lock for the reversing unit . If you move the lever to the lock position while power is applied to the tender it locks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reverse it will keep moving in reverse even when the transformer is turned off and on ) . If the lever is moved to the lock position after power is turned off it will lock in the next sequence position ( neutral ) if the reverse unit sequencer is working .

@@36015309 @5015309/ <h> Resale value of Dept 56 and Lemax buildings ? ? <p> I have an elderly friend " Joe " who will be closing out a large O-gauge train layout and collection , because he is downsizing and does not want to leave a burden for his heirs . He has dismantled what was a large layout in the space of a two-car garage . He is currently sorting out all the trains and accessories as a step towards selling them off . <p> " Joe " has a HUGE collection of Dept 56 ceramic buildings . His last layout had a major section set up as a Christmas fantasy theme with many lighted buildings and operating items . He says the Dept 56 buildings were rather expensive and he found Lemax ( and some other brands ) made similar items as good for much less money . <p> All items are in very good condition with original boxes ; some are new unused . He modified the lights by putting multiple lights on one cord instead of having to plug in each building separately . He has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Joe does not use internet . I 'm not interested in buying the ceramic buildings myself . It would be helpful if someone could pass along general advice about resale values for these sorts of items . He 's not in a big hurry to sell stuff and I imagine many of the items would sell better closer to Christmas season . <p> The dept 56 stuff seems to hold a pretty good value depending on the piece , though most of it is still for sale at pretty high prices , assuming in like new condition . <p> The Lemax stuff would probably vary . I 've bought some Lemax new from a CVS drug store for $15 a building , while others sell new for $30-40 per building . You may want to go look to Ebay and previously sold listings for different pieces to get an idea of what the average price they 're selling for is . Obviously it wo n't be 100% accurate , but it all comes down to what the buyer is willing to pay in the long run . <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ add to my collection each year , and the same buildings from different companies can range from $20-$100+ for the same piece depending on the seller , so it 's definitely a big variable . I think it would be safe to assume that he should n't expect the full original cost back , just like trains lose value over time . He might come close on the Dept 56 ones . <p> We have a bunch of this , 3 different villages . As with trains , how he plans to dispose of it makes a tremendous difference . <p> If he wants to sell individually , maybe ask 70% of new . If he wants to sell it all at one time , it is likely to be a good bit less as the buyer will need to make a profit . Would n't be surprised to see it go then for 33-37% of new , maybe less . <p> There used to be books that listed the values of each retired item . They should be listed on the Internet . Some pieces are in more demand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are . Wish him good luck . <p> I am by no means an expert on this . I do have maybe 10-15 Dept.56 buildings on my layout . I have found that I spend about on each building what I spend for a building kit . We are talking $45-$60 per building . The Dept.56 prices in their guide is what I used as a general guide , emphasizing general here . Certainly their are a select group of building in demand for high prices but in general I expect to pay around 40-50% of what they originally were selling for when issued . <p> We 've been setting up our initial layout and buying buildings for the same . The Lemax buildings sold through Sears , Kohls , Michaels , Ace Hardware lose 70-80% of their retail value right after Christmas . Unless it 's something someone really wants , the Lemax items priced at $70-80 can be bought post Christmas for $10-20 . Even at shows/meets I 've bought Lemax buildings for $10-15 . There is another forum member who has had a few Lemax buildings for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building . Nice buildings no doubt , but they do n't command a price . <p> Department 56 items might hold better value but you can go to a local consignment store and find boxes of them for $20 . I bid on certain items on ebay , and prices are all over the place for the same building much like trains . I 've been using this site to see what is a reasonable price for things I want - D56info.com . <p> I 'm not so sure he 'll get his money back on most of this stuff . To give you an example , I just bought Fisherman 's Nook 2 Cabin set for $17 . D56info shows them originally selling for $43 and with a current value of $25 . Looking at sold listings on ebay for this set you would find it sold anywhere from $11 to $45 ( 1 listing ) with more under $20 than above it . Of the 10+ buildings I 've bought so far , this is pretty typical of the pricing . <p> Hope this helps . <p> If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see what he has . My email is in my profile . <p> The best way to find a " resale value " is to find out what the exact ( such as box/no box ) item recently sold for . This is easily found out by doing a eBay " advanced search " for items actually sold . You can view items sold in the past 2 months to get a idea of high/low/average . It will also give a idea of supply in the marketplace ( in 2 months , 2 sold or 20 sold ? ) . <p> Understand that eBay has millions of lookers ... a yard sale , maybe 50 . <p> For the most part , " Value Guides " from a company , like Hallmark , should be called " Wishful Thinking " books . <p> There are certain Dept 56 pieces that are worth much more than others . Generally , $45 - $55 retail priced buildings will sell for $15 on eBay . However , a Starbucks or Allied Model Trains Lionel Toy Shop or a Victorian Train Station will sell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make the piece virtually worthless . There are several different lines of Dept 56 . Dickens Village used to be popular , but not so much anymore . Snow Village and Christmas in the City are popular for train layouts . Boxes also add some value if they are in good condition . <p> For Lemax , the animated pieces , such as the carnival pieces , are worth much more . <p> You wo n't find many sales until closer to Christmas . Oct is the start of the selling season on eBay . Also , there used to be a lot of shops that carried Dept 56 . I have found that most have gone out of business . This hurt the value of the collectible market . I suspect Lemax had something to do with that . <p> My wife collected these for a few years to put together our Christmas display . It was very easy to find them at York for $10 to $20 each complete in the box . Only a few special edition pieces for members only issues have held their value for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christmas stuff is common as nails and goes cheap . The only way E-Bay is a price gauge is because it in many cases is the only place to find them for sale outside of the manufacturers web site . <p> Thank you all for the input . I will pass along the information . I have to say I do n't envy this guy , trying to sell off all these items collected over a few decades . <p> " Joe " told me a story about one of his encounters with a dealer with who he had hoped to make a mass sale of train items . Joe was irritated with the guy 's lowball offer , virtually pennies on the dollar , dealer saying that he needed to cover his time and overhead and needed to make a profit on resale etc . Joe was carrying a Lionel passenger car and tripped , reached out and smashed the car on a table edge by accident -- but then turned to the dealer guy and says , " I 'll smash all these trains before I give them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , freaked ... <p> Wife and I have been assisting folks in Joe 's situation for about 15 years now . More often , though , Joe is gone ... it 's the heir(s) who are left to clean up , clean out . <p> But from your last story of his encounter with a dealer , I 'd say Joe is not seriously ready to sell . The only way he 'll make a single sale of the lot at a value that he feels is reasonable is to find someone who has been searching for his collection for their own use ..... and have a lot of discretionary money on hand . Geographically speaking ? ..... nothing short of a miracle . <p> There 's a lot of emotion involved in this sort of life change . Some of it , we 've learned , comes from a mix of disappointment that ' it 's over ! ' , and some of it from the realization that what was spent on this hobby is not going to return the financial nest egg that your heir(s) ... spouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're gone . In many respects it 's easier to assist in disposing of a collection such as this AFTER they 're gone , rather than with the hobbyist yet filled with the passion wrapped up in everything . We 're somewhat going through that right now with a prospective client . It 's not easy for any of us to deal with . <p> Better are the situations where the individual has found a new passion for which , considering their age and mortality , they 're eager-to-desperate to be rid of all ' anchors ' on their way to something new and exciting .... like moving to that spot of heaven on a sunny beach in a climate that never disappoints . We 've experienced folks like that , too ! Much easier .... several quotes , pick one , pack it up , done . <p> Were I in your shoes .... as a friend , not as a potential ' dealer ' .... I 'd be helping Joe sort through his options , understand the market , find and work with reputable , understanding potential buyers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it ... a trip or cruise , the freedom to pursue some new interest , that classic car he always imagined being behind the wheel of ..... a second honeymoon ..... something . <p> If the layout is yet intact , though , be sure to take LOTS and LOTS of photos , videos , etc .. Preserve the memory , the smiles . If ( as it sounds to me ) he created all this for the fun of it , then document his having fun with it . <p> OTOH , if he really expected to recover a lot of money for the fun he had , well ...... that 's where your friendship will be of value in helping him get through it all . Good luck ! <p> The " pennies on the dollar " common complaint needs to be better defined to be a real complaint . If someone is literally offering 2-5% of original purchase price , then yes , that would be a vulture ( unless everything is totally trashed , and in that case the prospective buyer would probably just pass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not be unreasonable , for the exact reasons ( though they seem stingy to the seller ) the prospective buyer states . <p> No dealer is looking to add any of our treasured items to a collection in their store to collect dust ( neither trains nor D56 type stuff ) . They are looking to be able to sell it themselves ( and somewhat quickly ) . The sale-ability of these 2nd hand items does n't magically go up by a huge amount just because the store is now selling it rather than the individual . They do have the benefits of being an established store , but that does n't make it easier to sell items no one really wants for higher prices . <p> The other thing for " Joe 's " collection not yet mentioned is the modified cords . Whether this would be a concern to any of us or not , the modification of the cords could be an issue to the general public . Most would probably consider this unsafe if they had splices in the 120 VAC cords , and would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unit usable . Essentially any item without a un-modified " plug to bulb " cord is damaged or missing something , making it harder to sell . <p> The rarity and desire thing probably translates to several well known train examples . For every Vision GE Evo Diesel or Ethanol Tank Car pack with sounds ( both commanding higher prices now ) , there are many more single unit Centipede engines or NASCAR sets ( still in the blow out lists of some dealers ) . <p> There are also probably a few analogous cases to " collectible " boxcars , see Macy 's Thanksgiving , Hellgate Bridge , HORDE , and Vapor . All considered somewhat collectible at the time they were released ( and for the Macy 's , people running to God knows how many Macy 's stores to find them ) , but now that their luster has worn off , there is little interest even if priced in the $20-$25 range per car . ( there were people easily paying $100 or more for some of these when they came out ) When is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great deal " on something like this ? The interest just dies down after a while . I suspect the same phenomena applies to quite a bit of D56 type stuff . <p> I just pulled all of my Department 56 out of storage and placed them on my layout , so I am really appreciative of this thread and all the input . <p> I have about thirty buildings total , most Department 56 and some of the other brands . For lighting I plan on LED 's at 18 Volts using three or four per building rather then the 120 VAC , 7W incandescent lamps provided . I left the lamp and pig tails in the associated packages if I should ever wish to sell them . <p> As for long term value , I am not too concerned about it . Just like my trains they are all for fun . I have all the boxes and they are saved , but to be honest the paper sleeves have developed rips , tares and fading over the years . I doubt if they will add much to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are in very good shape I think they will be worth keeping for shipping if it ever comes to that . <p> I told my wife when I 'm gone to go on the OGR and other web sites to get a handle on what items are going for , but unless she wont 's to make selling them a full time hobby she should get in touch with someone who does this full time and be ready to take a fifty percent hit on the going value .

With the relatively low value of these buildings , even taped boxes do n't mean much . It really comes down to how rare the building is and how pristine the ceramic and paint is . I have lots of these . I have sold a few and still buy a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good market on eBay where you can search past sales for each building and see current listings . For example , a Kingsford Road Brewhouse sold with a box for $7 plus $16 shipping . There are currently 10 Starbucks Dept 56 buildings listed with some Buy it Now 's listed for $199 . Sales are between $50 with no box , $65 with a box and $120 , because someone really wanted it . 175854 @qwx375854 175853 @qwx375853 <h> Block 175862 @qwx375862

@@36015317 @5015317/ <p> Let me start off by saying that this type of computer control is not for the faint of heart , but boy , is it powerful stuff . The main reason that I 'm using it on my railroad , instead of some of the newer technologies , is that I already own the equipment . <p> So what is CMR/I ?

I first heard of CMR/I back in my teen HO years ... ( i.e. , 40+ years ago in the mid-1970 's ) when Model Railroader magazine first covered the topic on Bruce Chubb 's Sunset Valley HO empire . <p> Like yourself , I 'm not an EE ... So I only understand the general concepts involved but not the electrical/hardware theory behind all the components . But I 'll jump in to contribute whenever possible . Hard to believe nearly 40 years have passed , since I first read about CMR/I . Where did the time go ? <p> BTW , as an FYI ... your images are all appearing as " image not found " boxes when I view your original post . So you might want to look into that . I 'd be interested in seeing them . <p> Good idea starting starting a new thread . I wa following you and Dale 's discussions on the other thread . I am interested in how CMR/I works . I 'll second David 's comment regarding the pictures . I can not see them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some reason , I can see them perfectly , and they were there when I wrote the captions . I do n't start a lot of topics , and the form looks different from a regular post . I tried to edit the post , but without getting Rich involved , I 'm not sure how to fix it . See if this works . I 'm pretty sure I can repair this if it does n't . I really want you to see them so we can get this conversation off on the right foot . <p> Let 's start with this gizmo .

I may still ask Rich to clean up the mess by repairing the images and perhaps editing your posts to take out the " ca n't see " bits . <p> David , the CMR/I series of articles ran in MR in 1985 and 86 . I would have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ references . I 'm sure he was developing the system years before . That said , I purchased my equipment in 1992 , but there were probably only minor changes to the hardware from when the series ran . So at best , I 'm working with late 70 's or early 80 's technology . Most of what I 'm using is still available , though there have been major new product advancements . <p> If you Google CMRI , it is difficult to find what you want . But if you Google JLC Enterprises , it comes right up . If I 'm not mistaken , JLC is his wife 's initials . Family business since day one . <p> David , the CMR/I series of articles ran in MR in 1985 and 86 . I would have to look back to see if there were any earlier published references . I 'm sure he was developing the system years before . That said , I purchased my equipment in 1992 , but there were probably only minor changes to the hardware from when the series ran . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's or early 80 's technology . Most of what I 'm using is still available , though there have been major new product advancements . <p> ... <p> MR had been featuring lots of articles on Bruce Chubb 's Sunset Valley RR in the 70 's ( maybe even earlier ) , but PC technology hit the early mainstream about 1983-ish with the IBM XT . I recall purchasing a second 10MB " hard-drive on a card " for it ... yes , a whopping 10MB ! ! ! I think my first PC was configured with 128K of main memory too . And those numbers are not a misprint . <p> So if you have the CMR/I articles in Model Railroader from 1985-86 , that 's a few years after PC 's were just starting to hit households ... but not nearly to the extent they did in the 1990 's . And now , of course , we 're all walking around with portable PC power and smartphones . Who would have thunk it back then ? ? ? <p> By " track " do you mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shorted axle ? <p> If so , then it 's consistent with what you 've described so far . That is , the detector " grounds " the CMRI input pin . The CMRI input pin drives the input of a digital logic gate ( 74LS04 ) . The gate input is pulled up to +5V by a resistor . <p> From what I can tell from your photos , the cap and smaller diode are as annotated below . Can you read the marking/lettering on the big diode ? 175852 @qwx375852 <p> Now that you mention that David , I do recall seeing a bunch of articles on Chubb 's layout long before the CMR/I series . I have every MR from 1950 to 2006 on my bookshelves , I 'll have to take a trip down memory lane . Lord knows mine is n't as sharp as it once was , spiders have taken up housekeeping . <p> I remember those early PC days too . My first one got stolen in about 1984 , and I moved up to an XT . I also remember the 10MB @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be larger than that . <p> When I was in college , my major was computer science and geography . Back then it was all about efficiency , the saving of time and space , because those things were limited and expensive . I get the feeling that software companies do n't care about those things anymore . If you buy their stuff and it runs too slowly , they expect you to buy a new computer . Heck , the kids who write software these days were n't even born in the pre Pentium era . <p> Stan , the only markings on those big diodes say DII 6A2 . Hope that tells us what we need to know . <p> This entire project is going to take a long time to become fully operational . It has to happen in stages . It was this image of one of my turnout relay panels that gave rise to this topic . <p> I 'm using these relays to simply flip the polarity going to the Tortoises . Once they are connected to the panel via the terminals on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circuit by applying power to the terminal at the bottom . In phase one , this will be done using temporary control panels with SPST micro switches . Phase two is when CMR/I kicks in . The panels will be removed and the control wires will be connected to the output cards . <p> Before the panels can be removed , I also have to set up JMRI Panel Pro and assign the CMR/I bits to the turnouts in the schematic . <p> Once that is up and running I can move to the detection portion . After that signaling. 175852 @qwx375852 <p> Here 's my guess at what you have . When an axle enters the detection track section , it shorts the screw-terminal labeled " track " to the Common of the DC power supply . I believe the 6A2 is simply for protection ( as opposed to part of the signal detection circuit ) . <p> The shorted " track " signal then discharges the 1000uF capacitor via the 1N4005 diode . The cap is normally charged to 5V via the 4.7K resistor . The 74LS04 digital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ digital signal onward to the computer controller . Somewhere you have a separate and isolated 5V DC supply to power the digital/computer components . The common of the DC supply is tied to the outer rail to allow isolated-rail detection . <p> Using this method , your track transformer voltage can be AC or DC , conventional or command voltage levels . I did not study the other ( long ) thread so hopefully this is n't just repeating ideas that have already been discussed . 175852 @qwx375852 <p> Impressive Elliot , even if it is 1980 's or early technology . To me a non-techie it might as will be out of the Space Shuttle ! I remember reading about Bruce Chubb and his computer articles , I 'm your age so it 's memory lane . Yep , My old sinclair and TRS " trash " 80 . Did you use this computer control system for layout control , was your previous layout at the mall of America back in the day ? Great thread . <p> I think I remember being told that that 6A diode was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This detection method is one of the things that makes 3 rail so neat , especially when you use track with all rails insulated . <p> Prior to the layout at the mall , the same EE designed a timer circuit for use with my portable layout . That layout used tubular track with classic insulated sections . The circuit was connected to the relay and had 3 inputs . One 24VDC + one 24VDC - and the third came from the insulated rail segment . Once again we superimposed that DC ground on the AC track common . Train hits the section , relay latches , and a trim pot sets the rate of discharge of a capacitor . Voila , timer ! <p> Impressive Elliot , even if it is 1980 's or early technology . To me a non-techie it might as will be out of the Space Shuttle ! I remember reading about Bruce Chubb and his computer articles , I 'm your age so it 's memory lane . Yep , My old sinclair and TRS " trash " 80 . Did you use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ previous layout at the mall of America back in the day ? Great thread . <p> Thanks George . That was the plan , to use it on the mall layout . The hardware was all set and ready to go . The snag was the software all had to be custom done . Shortly after we opened , it was clear that we could n't afford to keep throwing money at it , and we started bypassing the CMR/I elements , in favor of relay and micro processor solutions . <p> Fast forward 10 years . When I started thinking about what I was going to do for control systems on this layout , I knew I wanted to reuse the CMRI stuff . I had just discovered TMCC , and that serial port on the back of the command base . I thought would n't it be cool to combine the two and go for full automation . I nicknamed this concept " smart track and smart trains " . CMR/I would take of the smart track , with detection signaling and routing . <p> Once again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was starting to think that I was going to have to write it myself . I even bought a book on C++ . Then one day I heard about JMRI . I looked into it and realized that this was the MISSING LINK ! ! ! Lo and behold , already written into the system , were the TMCC command codes . <p> Not only can JMRI talk to the command base , but it is pretty much plug n play with CMR/I . Just build your layout schematic with Panel Pro , then assign your bits for detection , turnouts and signals . <p> There is little doubt in my mind that I will have to learn Java , and write some modules myself , but a lot of the hard part is already done . Best of all , it 's free ! <p> You do n't need to learn any Java to use JMRI .... besides the off-the-shelf signaling logic , you can create almost any behavior by defining ' logix ' within PanelPro . <p> For really complex stuff you can add custom scripts written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really understood what I 've been doing . <p> I 'm glad to see you here Prof. I really have n't examined the finer detail of what is available " off the rack " with JMRI . <p> Here 's an example of what I would like to start with in terms of automation . I have a very large storage / staging yard . It consists of five 120 ' long tracks . I 've divided each track into 5 stopping areas , so the yard can hold a max of 25 trains . When the first train in a queue leaves the yard , the subsequent trains need to advance to the next position . <p> I think the answer is yes , but that 's much more complicated than anything I have attempted with JMRI . I use JMRI mostly as a control panel to control turnouts , accessories , and operating cars ; an Arduino runs the trains but is limited to an ABS-like system That I developed . <p> But ( if you have n't already ) take a look at the Warrants section of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ automation capabilities . But it 's so complex it makes my head spin ! <p> Prof , thanks for pointing me in that direction . I 'll check it out . There is no rush with any of this , because the hardware probably wo n't be done enough for at least 8 to 10 months maybe more . I have a lot of work to do on the layout itself , I do n't even have the track fully powered . And then there 's Panel Pro . <p> Dale , you 're welcome . Yes this is old technology , but the cards are mass produced and sold loose or in kit form or you can have them assembled for an extra charge . The thing that 's homemade is the detection panel . Take your time and check it out when you 're fresh . This topic is n't going anywhere . <p> I actually use the C/MRI protocol to communicate between the Arduino and JMRI ; the Arduino emulates C/MRI nodes in software to keep JMRI apprised of layout status , and let JMRI control layout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass TMCC commands to the Arduino , which then passes them on to the Command Base . <p> So if you wanted , you need n't be confined to actual C/MRI hardware . You could connect any kind of I/O hardware you wanted to the Arduino , and make it look like C/MRI hardware to JMRI . <p> This book by Bruce Chubb describes the C/MRI hardware and protocol in detail , though I think there are newer boards not covered in the book . <p> I 've got the book , autographed too . Got all the hardware as well , except an input card or two as mentioned earlier . Our paths have crossed a few times here in the forum , but you may not be familiar with the magnitude of my layout . It 's quite the undertaking really . <p> Here are some vital statistics : <p> The room is 1900 sqft <p> The layout is 2200 sqft because it is full double and part triple deck <p> There is over 3000 ' of track <p> The mainlines are about 6 scale miles long <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Tortoises with 20 being crossovers <p> There are 74 power districts <p> Over 200 detection blocks <p> It is powered by six 20 Amp power supplies <p> It has 32 train staging capacity <p> There are two helixes a 10 ' diameter and an 8 ' diameter <p> If you 'd like to see what it looks like just click on the links in my signature . <p> BTW , I just downloaded JMRI to this computer . Now I have to figure out how to use the layout editor . I still need to check out the section you mentioned earlier . Long day , but a good one . <p> Glad you started a new thread . It 's a good subject and something I am interested in as well , but not very knowledgeable about . One of the problems I have is the fact that all the C/MRI and JMRI equipment and information is for DC/DCC and I have all AC with Legacy &amp; DCS . The interfacing between DC and AC with the equipment seems a bit confusing to me . I will follow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it will stick . <p> Glad you started a new thread .

The interfacing between DC and AC with the equipment seems a bit confusing to me . I will follow along and study the websites some more , maybe some of it will stick . <p> What you use for track power does n't really enter into the picture . The only place that I can think of where you would come into contact with track power is detection , and that does n't really happen , but that big diode is there just in case . <p> Study the diagram above that Stan drew . That 's what the detection panels are for . They serve as a buffer and an interface between C/MRI and the track . The way I 'll be doing it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rail along with the AC common and the TMCC signal . The passing train allows that DC ground to get back to the detection panel , and then back to the C/MRI input bit . From there , it goes back to the computer and is processed by JMRI . <p> If you wanted to , I suppose you could also control accessories with C/MRI and JMRI as Professor Chaos suggested , however for that , you would probably need a relay . You would have a C/MRI output bit drive the relay and allow AC or DC any voltage to pass . You can find banks of up to 8 relays mounted on a card for cheap on eBay . I think they have 5VDC coils and are perfect for these applications . <p> Train detection was mostly what I was talking about . I looked at the CMRI site and their detection modules are either DC or DCC . I have relays ( AC and DC ) and also some of the relay banks from ebay . I have been fiddling with an Arduino and photo resistors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happens . I think stan2004 also told me something about DC mixing with the AC on the rails one time , may be the same method you are using here that he was talking about . I suppose that would be isolated rail , only with DC . I really do n't have a layout large enough to justify all this , but I still find it fun to fiddle with ... and I do hope to expand someday . <p> Without going into C/MRI , you may be able to accomplish the superimposed DC ground method with Arduino . You 'll probably still want to use the diodes and capacitor between the track and the input of whatever system you use . I 'm not 100% sure , but I think the purpose of the capacitor is to smooth out the signal so the input does n't see a " flicker " . Even if your wheels and track are clean there can be momentary signal loss . <p> I 'm sure Stan or one of the other electronics experts could confirm or deny my theory . <p> Ordered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ datasheets for Prof Chaos ' chips . Your board looks very interesting . My photo resistors do n't seem to be all that reliable so far , either that or it 's my Arduino code ?

@@36015320 @5015320/ <p> I briefly looked in on it and was also amazed at how much the lots were selling for . Totally out of line compared with what you would expect to pay at a train show , or even on eBay . I think people sometimes get caught up in the adrenaline rush of a live auction and get a bit carried away . <p> Hi Tommy . I 've watched this happen month in and month out for almost eight years . As the COO of the company you are speaking of , I thought it would be worth a moment to explain some of the factors that played into some of the prices you have witnessed this weekend . <p> 1 . It 's January . Historically our strongest prices of the year are found in January , February and March . <p> 2 . We not only have our in house bidders , but we have absentee bidders , plus all the bidders that Ebay / Ebay Live brings to the table . That 's why you see the sudden jump in prices , it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Ebay and through our website . We are by volume the largest toy train auction house in the US , and realistically we get more eyeballs on our listings than most other venues . <p> 3 . The fact that it is an auction plays into it . The reality is we have some buyers with pretty deep pockets , and sometimes folks do get caught up in the bidding . I 've walked away from a few sales shaking my head myself at some of the prices paid . There are folks in this hobby with way more money than the average buyer has and when they flex their money muscle , they usually win . <p> 4 . Rolling stock prices have been very strong the past year . It 's a mix between resellers and individual collectors driving the market . It seems that people are really looking for rolling stock at the moment . <p> My point to all this is , we appreciate you looking and I encourage you not to get frustrated . Our job is obviously to make as much money as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ average collector to have opportunities as well . We did n't become America 's largest toy train auction company only serving the high end collectors . We need the general hobbyist as well . <p> Trust me , there are deals to be had ! Keep an eye out , especially after the weather warms up a bit and I think you 'll be surprised with the opportunities you have . <p> The behind the scenes of one of America 's most famous hobby shops . Click Here to order your copy from the second printing of the book . The book is in stock and ships daily . <p> I can echo those sentiments , albeit to a much smaller degree . I sold off all , well most , of my 3-rail engines , rolling stock , track , command systems , track , etc. on eBay and a little bit here but mostly eBay last Summer/Fall . I was amazed how much some of this stuff sold for , about 80% it was Atlas . Pines trailers over $80 and 89 ' flat cars over $200 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buyers and I suspect that some of them are well off financially . <p> Never argue with a fool , onlookers may not be able to tell the difference . <p> A great bunch of people only about 20 min. from my home went to several auctions and got some of my favorite engines , cars , etc . Also meet several local people I did n't know were into trains . Just dropped off several engines etc. for a friend who died for them to sell knowing they will get a fair price for the family . &amp; Derek is n't a bad guy either LOL ! <p> I always have to chuckle when I read a lost of posts nailing the coffin closed on pre-war and post-war collecting and constantly reiterating that prices on these items are near rock bottom . I have posted several times that if that was the case why are some of the live/internet auctions commanding such high prices and sometimes on goods that are no better than C-6 OR C-7 . Like many others I watched and participated in both of these auctions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the least bit frustrated . Actually , I feel kind of vindicated . I 'm looking forward to the next one . <p> I want to thank you for your timely and honest response to my post . I agree with you 100% . I applaud you and your efforts to enhance the profitability of your consignors . That is the American way of free enterprise . Your sellers make a profit , and a dollar filters down to you . I am at ease with your site and will continue to visit . My best regards <p> I won two lots on Friday , both brand new engines , MTH PS3.0 , with all factors in place -- buyers premium , credit card fee , shipping , my out the door price is 54% of MSRP . <p> Now I have bought more than a few trains over the years , many from hobby shops often during a time when they 're having an extra 10% or 15% off sale , but never have I been able to buy brand new C9 engines at 46% off ! <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my view , I have bought thousands of dollar in trains from them over the past three years , even driven the four hours over a few times to pick up a car load of trains . They are great people who run a quality business , and if you watch the auctions , set a limit including all the associated fees there are often great deals to be had , they also often have those items no one else ( including train shows and eBay ) do n't ... those are not often a bargain , but at least one can buy them if their wallet will allow . <p> All I can say , is thanks to them and I am looking forward to new engines pulling great rolling stock I 've bought from them in the past , rolling around the layout in a few weeks . <p> I appreciate the candid observations . I 've always found some humor in watching these showdowns between seniors hopped up on synthetic testosterone . No brains , but a ton of money . They push prices beyond sanity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business . But ... observing this stuff has made me sit out most of your auctions recently because of my perception everything is beyond reach , so why bother . Keep in mind that prices are always set by a small minority of very deep pocketed bidders , whose bidding behavior may actually be deterring other bidders . In a few years , these old guys with all their cash will be gone , and you 'll be selling their stuff again , to guys like me in my early forties . In the mean time , I 'll just sit back at watch the spectacle . And BTW , I love your book on Madison ! <p> I Have hit the button a few items , on the place in either state , we all know . But you have to watch , and see if its live auctioneer bid , competitive bid , <p> or floor , big difference in your totals There are times you say , OK , do I really want . I viewed the bay hoppers at the end , and I guess the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not 4 bay . The Canadian Maple leaf set , I purchased , about 10 months , ago , and $20 more , but mine was completely sealed in the shipping carton un opened , so I guess the realized price is Ok . Think also , there would be the large following from the other or past auction over in CT , that is no longer in existence , so you picked up another crowd . That obviously are not going to take chances on York , ( hahha ) . I would say that the gas and Motel , far exceeds the cost in shipping . <p> The thing I like about auctions is that the buyers set the price an item sells for . <p> The only thing that needs to be fair is everyone who wants to bid has the opportunity to . <p> Other than that , if I am bidding against someone for an item that I really want , and I am willing to or can spend more money than they want to or can , I win . <p> Likewise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to or can spend on an item , they win it . <p> People who spend more money on an item than others think it 's worth are not stupid , etc .. They just want an item , and can afford it . <p> I have bypassed many auction items as they are out of my comfort zone . Oh well . I live to see another day . After all these are hobby items , not life essential items ( food , water , etc . ) <p> An interesting thing I have found when I sell things at auction , whether trains or music gear ; the items I start well below the going price , sell for the most money . The so called bidding excitement starts as the bids ramp up.If someone wants the item , they bid accordingly , and win it . They 're happy , and I 'm happy . <p> I often attend a train auction in East Earl PA . I usually go prepared to pay X amount of dollars , and if the price exceeds my limit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with many of the same items , so there are rarely scarce items at the sales . I have enough locos , diesel , electric and steam , but I have a list of things I would like , but am not going to go hog wild to acquire them . I have been trying to buy 6464 cars ( no boxes needed ) and I would really like a 3435 aquarium car , any version , but I enjoy going to the auctions and watching the " fur " fly . <p> Gregr posted " ...

It 's all part of the " game . " <p> As a general statement and not necessarily anything to do with the auction of which you speak , auctions are a notoriously dirty business and few houses take the precautions to ensure everything is truly as above-board as possible . In this case , I 'd be curious to know if the auction house has a house account and can bid in its own auctions - it 's legal in several states and the reason one giant auction house moved to Texas . Of course , that dynamic has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and away . Also curious to know if sellers are permitted to bid on their own items ?

Occasionally , I 'll grab an item off eBay if I know the seller . Otherwise , you ca n't beat this forum for great buy/sell transactions . <p> Given the glut of toy trains on the market today ... Unless something is extremely desirable -- like a BNSF die-cast ES44 #6436 , for example -- i 'd be highly suspicious of an auction house , if run-of-the-mill items are fetching unusually high prices regardless of what time of year it 's sold . Seasoned buyers know the market value of these things . <p> As a general statement and not necessarily anything to do with the auction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business and few houses take the precautions to ensure everything is truly as above-board as possible .

We do not allow our sellers to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few try in the past and have quickly put a stop to it . Anyone that allows that to happen is asking for trouble and it is one of the quickest ways to discourage bidding from other parties . <p> 3 . The software we use in house is one of the larger systems on the market and it does not allow us to see the high bids from absentee , Ebay , etc . There are three of us in Indiana that have full access to that system and even if we wanted to we could not see that information . <p> I understand people 's need to be skeptical , and the reality is some folks are cut out to be our customers and others are not . We are entering our 25th year in business and we have brought some of the best collections in the United States to market . Some of those included Richard Kughn ( Part one of Madison Hardware ) , Jim Sattler , Frank Pettruzo , and many others . To the modern guys those names wo n't mean much , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some heavy hitters . This year alone we are bringing the Bob Ford collection , George Klett collection , and Jim Seacrest collection across our blocks in just the first third of the year . Anyway , the point is we did n't end up here by accident . I understand that some of these questions are general questions , but I 'm not a fan of even having dishonest practices implied in the same general thread about our company , especially if you 've never worked with us before . <p> The behind the scenes of one of America 's most famous hobby shops . Click Here to order your copy from the second printing of the book . The book is in stock and ships daily . <p> My previous post regarding " deep pocketed " collectors deserves clarification . Although sarcastic , it was not intended as an indictment of those with wealth , or the means to achieve their dreams . I 'm also not saying anything negative about the business practices of auction houses . Many operate with the utmost integrity , including the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business . My post was intended to convey my frustration with the bifurcation of the train collecting market over the past couple of decades , and the unpredictable impact on pricing that this split has created , particularly with auction houses . <p> The first group consists of those who have collected for many years . They will remember a more level playing field : a world where the completeness and quality of one 's collection was determined solely by the years of personal effort expended in scrounging through garage sales , basements , attics , and train meets . These folks collected cherished items one-by-one . They read books , studied production history , examined each piece carefully , and took the time to clean and oil , or perhaps restore each piece with tender loving care . Sometimes they would even buy like new , or even mint condition trains without spending $5,000 . They did n't have to deal with the Internet . Ordinary men of ordinary means could purchase trains at reasonable prices without having to deal with snippy " google search " owners who think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second group , which has evolved more recently may be best described as the johnny come lately " insta-collectors " . By saying this , I do not mean to disparage new collectors . Everyone started somewhere , myself included . These are the guys who find themselves at the age of 65 or 70 , retired with a pile of cash and bountiful time . Maybe a friend turned them onto trains , maybe something else . But here they are . They do n't have the time to learn about the trains or their history , to buy and savor them one at a time , or learn to repair them for that matter . They are far behind and need to catch up . That is where the auction houses have a role . The modern Internet auction house is realistically the sole venue serving the " insta-collector " . Where else can one back up a truck , walk in with one-hundred thousand dollars , and walk out a few hours later with a nearly complete post-war collection in like new condition ? If you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't get caught between a couple of these fellows as they will " highball " through the day 's bidding at any expense . Remember , they have n't read Greenberg 's , do n't know the prices , and frankly do n't care . They probably do n't even know what they are bidding on . They just want a complete collection right NOW . Therefore , with a day 's hard work raising their bidding finger , the " insta-collector " accumulates what took others decades . They truck it all home . Some leave it in boxes , while a few put the trains on shelves , and proudly boast their achievement . Sometimes we honor these achievements : just look at the guy whose collection of clear shell F3 's was honored in a 2013 CTT issue . Was he to be honored because of thousands of hours of sweat and blood working on a layout , or was he merely celebrated because he spent more cash than everyone else to horde every clear shell F3 in existence ? <p> The prevalence of these " insta-collectors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ auctions have become similar to high-browed Sotheby 's fine art auctions . We all know it 's the CEO 's and princes that walk away with fine art without even appreciating their purchases . It 's never the art-history professor on a 50k salary who can afford that which he has long cherished . <p> I bid often ( win much less often ) with Stout .. yes I said the name oooga , booga , booga , booga . <p> First , they are a great auction house , when I do win everything goes smoothly and I have to date been extremely happy . <p> Now on to the prices , as was indicated by Notch 6 in the first quarter of the year prices are generally higher . I used to track prices from several auction houses and EBay . These are the winter months and for those not into winter sports have time to play with their trains . <p> Realized prices for this auction did seem a bit higher even taking into account the 1 qtr phenomenon.I was on the phone with a another friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amazed . <p> It could be that now that the election and inauguration are over there was some emotional relief and folks want to spend some hard earned cash .. <p> Maybe the bidders wives were off marching .. because I would never take advantage of my wife not being around to buy trains , no never .. really <p> Seriously , I think another contributor is the MSRP of new items and that paying 50% - 75% of MSRP for items at auction with the premium and shipping is still cheaper than buying at a LHS . <p> There are several factors . After spending two years liquidating a large pre war , post war , and modern collection including standard , O , and S , I have observed the following . Most buyers do not want to pay what it takes to get an item . They want it for next to nothing . Occasionally you will come across a true collector who is willing to pay what it takes to get the item they need . But most of those seasoned collectors already have most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood is not entering the ranks and collecting those areas . Pre-War and Post War trains are falling like rocks . The people who enjoyed them when they were kids , already came back and collected them , and are now also trying to liquidate so the market is flooded with product . New product is also flooding the market . Most buyers today want the new stuff with all of the features , and the like . Many of these items were or are made in somewhat limited numbers so there are always buyers looking for something they missed . My best and quickest sellers were newer MTH and Lionel equipment . Venue . Train shows typically were few and far between , and rarely drew the crowds like they used to in the hey day . Many times its the same buyers , with the same sellers with the same stuff . E-Bay is better as you can reach more buyers , but I found that a majority of buyers wanted everything for pennies on the dollar . Large auction houses have the most exposure and draw buyers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unlike E-Bay where they can sit on it for a week and take the chance that it will be relisted at a lower price . <p> LionelTin replied ...

Virtually every major auction house - I mean the big ones that are household names and that deal in multimillion dollar items that span genres ( fine art , relics , etc. ) such as Sotheby 's , Christie 's and Mastro to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even the well-known auction houses that constantly have the " watchdog " spotlight on them , mess up . On that basis , I think anyone who would argue that the auction model ( or any particular auction house ) can be deemed above-board - without some articulation of its policies and practices - is a fool or ignorant to the world around them . And I think anyone who runs an auction house that does n't welcome my kind of questions , and the opportunity to provide the details to help allay concerns , needs to put on his big boy pants if he plans to grow his business to include more of those coming into the market . <p> In short , you 've decided to go into a business known for having the potential for unscrupulous behavior . You want people to spend their money to support your business . And you take offense to a potential new customer asking a few basic questions to help with the comfort level in giving you my money . Interesting ..... <p> If it is the " S " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is verboten ) , I had a few good experiences with them early last year ( via the live eBay interface ) when I was looking for some add-on items to complete my PWC Canadian Pacific set . <p> The one thing I should have paid more attention to was that there are multiple venues ( my fault , not theirs - location was clearly stated in the auction ) . <p> My first win was from their location outside of my home state , the second was within my home state , so I did n't properly account for the sales tax when thinking up my max bid . I was still happy , and it was my fault for not noticing that detail . <p> As to the items themselves , the 1st I got for what was probably a little better or in-line with other eBay auctions for the item . The second lot was an interesting situation that paired 2 items together . The one item I had , but the last piece I needed is not offered for sale regularly at what I consider my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the item I would now have a duplicate for . The pair went for probably less than the one piece would have on a stand alone auction ! So I got my missing item , and someone else at April York ( fellow table holder in Red hall ) got a decent deal on the one I considered my spare for the item I now had 2 of . <p> And what with the TRAINZ auctions ? Every time I get one of their flyers and click on one of them , the auction is already closed . Every time . Why send out the flyers ? ? ? Even when I check immediately after it hits my inbox . Auction closed . <p> LionelTin replied ... " After spending two years liquidating a large pre war , post war , and modern collection including standard , O , and S , I have observed the following .

What exactly does it take , to get an item @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to pay as little as possible for something , who would n't ? That sort goes without saying , does n't it ? <p> Mark , it means that if an item is worth $500 fair value , only certain persons will pay that if that is what it takes to get the item for their collection or layout . When I collected I had a list of needed items , when I saw them I would most times pay what it took to get the item for the collection within reason . By that I mean I would not over pay for the sake of getting the item . For example a $500 item marked at $850 would sit , but a prime example at $600 might sell . I did n't wimper around wanting the item for $200 and losing out . That is what it takes , or what it took . Sort of like , do n't bring a knife to a gunfight ..... <p> Notch6 , are you the auction house that has everything at $10.00 on ebay and the auctions are on Fridays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am not sure who this is and how well they back up what is sold . <p> That 's us . The $10.00 is somewhat misleading as Ebay does not adjust the current bid while it is on their site . It 's only once the auction is live that Ebay talks to our software and calculates where the bid is actually at . You can see current bids in the days leading up to the auction on our website . <p> As to backing up what we sell , we absolutely will stand behind our grade on an item , but rule #1 in our terms and conditions is that we sell based on visual appearance only , we do not test functionality of any item . Some people see this as a major issue for them , but you will find many others that can live with the risk and appreciate the money they save in return . Many of the collections we sell are high end , one owner collections and I would say we get calls about non functioning items maybe every other auction at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up front . <p> The behind the scenes of one of America 's most famous hobby shops .

You have to push , or fish , the wires through the mold , fittings are two piece , note the " L 's " shown . Top of the fitting , is installed/ clipped on , after the wires are installed . Note that in most cases the metallic mold should be grounded . There is plastic , non-metallic mold . There is also an assortment of electrical boxes , ( example : 5747 ) , designed to work with the mold . Mold boxes will accept any standard electrical device or multiples . Also works with all standard electrical plates . <p> Let me see if I still remember wiremold . Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to start closest to the door and pull the wire and snap the 90s on before moving to the next circuit ? With all that so close together I would think it would be a nightmare to pull through the corners otherwise . <p> I do like the way it looks ; It resembles brick mold trim . Is all the wiring in wiremold , or did you switch to a less expensive raceway where it was n't so visible ? Probably best not to talk about how much this stuff costs on this forum , as some members will gasp ! <p> I cheated . I chose not to fish the wire . What is not shown are all the tight turns and short runs . Kind of a pain to fish tight multi angle pockets of turns . <p> I cut and fitted the empty wire runs to dry mounted corners which had leads plugs drilled/mounted in the cinder block and cantilevered benchwork members .

The order does not matter . ) Does the magnet still pull down the coupler plungers as they pass over the track ? If so , there is a short in the track itself between the coil and the center rail . If not , the controller is probably shorted and you 'll need to look for a replacement . <p> I had several of these 6029/#90 uncoupling tracks , circa 1957 . They were very reliable and rugged . ( I 've melted several of the newer versions . ) These came with normal steel pins , insulating pins were not necessary . <p> Thanks everyone . As I 'd already disconnected the wires from the uncoupling track I attached them again . I tried again with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ #90 controller . How exactly does it work ? Does the button push the metal strips down on black backing ? I think it might already be there without pushing the button ? Maybe trying it without the back would work . 175852 @qwx375852 <p> To test the #90 , use a ohm meter . Put each of the leads from the meter to each post on the controller and press the controller button . If the meter reacts their is continuity and indicates the controller is functioning correctly . <p> As I look at this more , I 'm pretty sure the two silver metal strips touching completes the curcuit and powers the uncoupler . These 2 strips are pressed firmly together . I just bend they so they are apart when not being touching , right ? <p> EDIT : now I 'm doubting that . Pushing them further apart seems impossible , plus how would the button work ? It 's touching the longer one which is already on bottom , so pushing the button just pushes the bottom one down . ( they 're always touching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I guess nobody takes them apart and takes a photo . The back is imprinted " Control Switch No. 90 The Lionel Corporation New York , N.Y .

Try to put aside for a moment all the talk about what buttons are correct , what buttons still are made , etc etc etc . <p> We will get you a satisfactory result if you just do a few simple tests . Do you understand how an uncoupling track works ? It 's very simple : A coil of wire ( the red thing ) is energized momentarily ( regardless of the type of pushbutton -- we 'll get to that in a minute ) and becomes a magnet for the duration of the time that electricity is flowing through it . It is called an electro-magnet . <p> The pushbutton , whether a #90 or any other simple momentary contact ( like the man said : a household doorbell button will work ) simply completes the circuit through its two metal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is air ( no connection ) when not pressed , and a solid contact when pressed . <p> When the electromagnet is energized , it will attract any piece of steel or iron , just like a plain old magnet . The uncoupling tab on the bottom of coupler , when pulled downward , will uncouple the car . <p> If you plan to play with electric trains and enjoy learning how they work , it 's advisable that you get yourself a cheap digital multi-meter . They can be bought for about 12 bucks at Radio Shack , or on line . <p> You describe several symptoms . Let 's take them one at a time . <p> 1 . The train locomotive ( you call it a switcher ) stops suddenly when it rolls over the uncoupling track . That could mean that one of its center rail rollers has gotten to the red plastic part of the track , and the other roller is not still making contact with the center rail . Questions : What is the model number of the locomotive ? Does it have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the internal wiring correctly ? ( You need a meter to test that reliably ) <p> 2 . The locomotive " disconnects " ( I think you mean that it uncouples from the train ) and the tab continues to be attracted to the red coil . Is that what happens ? You need to check the wiring of the uncoupling track section with a meter to see if there is a cross ( short circuit ) between the coil and the center rails sections . Something is causing electricity to interconnect the center rail ( supposed to be energized all the time ) and the coil wiring ( supposed to be UN-energized until you press the button ) <p> The 6029 is a very flimsy , and inexpensive track accessory . You can get a newer one from many sources , if it 's found to be at fault . <p> The #90 pushbutton is simplicity itself . It has two metal contacts , and they need to be " open " ( not touching ) until you press the button .

Someone has switched the two strips so it is now NC ( normally closed ) instead of NO ( normally open ) . The rivet/button object at the middle of the wide strip is actually the contact side - it should not be visible . This is the source of the short circuit . <p> This may have been done intentionally to add a direction control button to a transformer that did n't have one , or to the C or B dials of a ZW , for example . <p> The train is pulled by a LV 626 44 Ton Switcher . With no wires attached to the uncoupler the train runs over it just fine . I have previously taken the engine apart and its been running fine since , except on the uncoupler when wires are attached . <p> I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The two pieces of metal are more than touching , there pushed together . <p> I have gotten it working by manually pulling the strips apart ( which always turns if off ) and then pushing them together ( usually works to turn it on ) . see picture I tried switching the metal pieces but have found this to be working best , by pulling the longer one up for off . Is there a way to fix it , that is a correct angle/position for the metal strips ? Or is it best/most reliable to get the non-lighted doorbell ? <p> Right now I just have a figure 8 with one loop on the outside of one side . It contains 2 manual switches so I 've been trying to get the few other pieces I have working to make it a little more interesting .

Rotate the orange button so that the long arm fits into the cutout portion . Both metal arms should have the little round contact point you see in the middle of the long arm . <p> When assembled correctly the contact points should not touch . When you press the button you force the long arm contact point to touch the short arm contact point . This completes the circuit and energizes the magnet in your 6029. 175854 @qwx375854 175853 @qwx375853 <h> Block 175862 @qwx375862

The Atlas was first out , and originally lacked any speed control . I added EOB to my NYCS unit right away quick . My NH RS1 has speed control and runs terrific as is . Both have Alco 244 V12 sound , which is inacccurate for this locomotive . I also picked up a Suzie Q RS1 in two rail from Atlas . She lacks the sound and control gear of the two three rail models , but has awesome looks all the way around . Better speed control here was brought about by wiring the motors in series . My MTH RS1 is the first run PRR . She lacks smoke and lit number boards . Newer versions correct this oversite . The truck side frames on the MTH are not exactly correct for anything , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The sound on the MTH is true 539T ... and so accurate that a customer at the store thought there was something wrong with the system when we ran it on the store layout ! The MTH has great running capabilities thanks to Proto 2.0 . It 's a given that I 'll have to spring for a newer version to get the smoke and working number boards . OTOH , Atlas has some absolutely dynamite roadnames available on their RS1 ... enough so that they are tough to ignore . I see LOK sound has a terrific Alco 539T chip for HO RS1s , and this should be an easy install on the O gauge model , be it old or new . As for the prototype , if there ever was a Diesel that really could be considered an honorary steamer , surely this crusty , chirpy , smoking Alco is it ! <p> I have the Earlier ( from about 10 years ago ) Atlas SF Zebra striped RS-1 and it is a beauty . I also have the Southern Railking RS-1 from couple of years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do not see that the Atlas is that much better detailed than MTH 's .

They both have separately applied steps , same looking metal railings , great graphics and painting . I can not see much difference in the trucks as they both look very similar with about the same level of cast in detail . I guess there were some extra lines for the brakes on the Atlas but one by one they came loose and showed up along the tracks . <p> I would say that the MTH RS-1 is one of the best detailed scaled sized diesel values in the market place today . <p> I have two ATSF and two CNW RS1 's from Atlas .

If John Armstrong can build one , why ca n't I ? <p> I was first going to convert a DPM corner store resin kit into the cafe , but after examining what I 'd have to destroy to get it there , it seemed better to scratch-build it . Since I was planning on building a Victorian era city tavern from plans in a 1950s Model Railroader magazine , it seemed natural to install the Night Hawk 's Cafe in that building . The front window of the building Hopper painted is a corner also and has a curved glass window wrapping around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ model has a round turret protruding from the corner , it would blend nicely with the curved corner of the cafe . <p> I downloaded a copy of the painting and then messed with perspective so it was straight sided . To re-acquaint folks , here 's the original painting . <p> The image is American Impressionism , and therefore , is not photographically correct . At first I thought the building was at 90- , but after reading more about the composition , Hopper situated the building on a sharper corner so the glass around the corner would be entirely behind the three main characters . I have a acute angle corner in my city , but it 's located towards the rear and the building would be facing the wrong way making it impossible for people to get a good look at the work . I 'll take liberties and make it square . Since we 'll dealing in three dimensions , not two , my viewers will be able to change their viewing angle and see the entire scene . The only red in the painting is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building was brightly lit with flourescents and I have one that I can use . It 's also going to be my first attempt to hand carve O'scale figures . The picture I downloaded has such high resolution that it will be a good guide for the sculpture . <p> Many Hopper fans have tried to find the business in Greenwich Village that may have been the subject for the painting with little luck . Hopper may have used a composite of places he knew , but noted that he enlarged the restaurant to make it bigger and brighter . In O'scale I 'm not going to distort it to match the painting . It would seem out of place . <p> I 'm also planning on a row of stores across the street like the ones depicted in the painting . One of the interesting things is how the light from the diner lights those buildings . <p> I already have the coffee urns ordered from Westport Model Works . <p> Here 's the plans drawn in O'scale . <p> Hopper 's painting also had no entrance .

Looking forward to seeing it develop . <p> As a painter myself , who had studied Hopper in school , I have a few comments/observations about Nighthawks . <p> As for the diner not having a door , actually it does have one in sight and another implied ... There is the tan door on the right , which does give a visual " entrance " to the scene . However , it is visually blocked and boxed in by various lines ( red counter , green &amp; black window frame ) and so " inaccessible " . Also note how the right hand pane of the front window is the same rectangle shape of the rear tan door . This composition arrangement creates depth by forced perspective . <p> As for the implied door , that is based upon the viewers own knowledge , i.e.you " know " it is a pubic restaurant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angle of the front window not only draws the viewer into the entire scene , but also implies an entrance door just out of sight to the right . <p> The composition of no obvious door , the rectilinear shapes boxing the figures in and other aspects do create the trapped in space and time effect . <p> Hopper also used artistic license in not showing any reflections in the window glass . This makes the painting dramatically easier to render and also adds an irony of making the figures more accessible ( i.e. no glass - yes , your mind 's eye does notice that ) while still being trapped , as described above . Note how the light from the diner illuminates the buildings across the street , creating a rectangular shape , but there is no reflection in the building 's windows . In fact , a second light source is implied , probably a street light , making the white triangle on the interior wall and shadow on the desk . Still no reflection in the window glass . <p> Nighthawks does display the compositional tool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is how the viewer is cut off from the main image by a line or series of lines . As in this train themed painting ... <p> In Nighthawks , the main image is isolated by the black shadow on the sidewalk and the green line of the window sill . <p> Not to sound overtly negative , but every critique has good and bad ... Notice how the painting does not show feet . In fact , look at any Hopper painting and you will not find well rendered feet . He could not paint feet . In the case of Nighthawks it works just fine . You may also note in various Hopper paintings poorly rendered hands . He did n't do hands and feet well . And every female model in all his paintings is his wife . She would not let him use models . <p> All that said , Hopper 's Nighthawk is a great painting . And yes , I have seen the real painting multiple times . But personally , I feel Nighthawks and a few other Hopper paintings are positive anomalies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ static and quite boring actually . But hey , he gave us Nighthawks , which is more then any artist can really aspire to . <p> Sorry if you find this lengthy and dull . <p> Good luck with your project . 175852 @qwx375852 <p> I 'm not sure , but that J Hudson is definitely not Bristish , and since the Nighthawks was supposed to be somewhere in Greenwich Village , having a Hudson around would n't be too far off . I 've never seen pictures of his whole layout . It must be spectacular . <p> I do not find your response dull . In fact , I found it enlightening . I too noticed a clumsiness about the way he does figures , but ascribed it to a desire to not be overly realistic , not to an inability to execute . Early Picasso 's had very well-drafted figures and his later stuff ... well , let 's just say his later stuff did n't . So to be truly reflective ( no pun intended ) of the painting , I should avoid glazing the windows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The curved glass is the most challenging aspect of the whole project . <p> Yes , I 'd say getting that curved glass will be the tricky part for your project . Maybe you can find something already formed to cut to fit , like a plastic bottle ... ? ? ? <p> The outer edge of that curved glass pane in Nighthawks is the only actual glass piece rendered in the painting , and Hopper cleverly involved it in an abstract composition of shadows and highlights in the window across the street . Very clever . <p> Oh , and when I studied Hopper in school I looked at a lot of his sketches and drawings ... He certainly had his talents , but hands and feet were not one of them . <p> One question , do you plan to also curve the building molding , if so mind sharing how ? I have to this point only been reading about the use of plastics , so perhaps I am way off and that can easily be done with a form and heat gun . <p> There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forms , knowing how to achieve this would be a real asset to my modeling . <p> For the windows sills ( top and bottom ) I 'm thinking about cutting them out of flat .040 " sheet with the curve . For the rest of the molding , if you use .020 " sheet , it 's flexible enough to probably bend it without heat and use some inside backing . In fact , if you laminate two ( or more ) sheets together around a mold , they will maintain that shape , just like laminating skis or a toboggan . I 'll have to make a mold of the curve and the rest should be easy ... ; - ) <p> Actually , I have much more apprehension in carving the figures than building the structure . <p> Having been a Hopper fan for several decades now since first visiting the Whitney in NYC . However i incorporated " Nighthawks " into my layout somewhat by accident . <p> In the small area of vacant land near the Warthog Coal &amp; Oil Co. i had planned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and eatery in Rome , NY . However eldest daughter ( MTS Harvard Divinity and JD Boston College Law ) felt the property was better suited for a Pentecostal Church ( currently under construction ) , and threatened legal action if i built an establishment that served alcohol . <p> Hence i was forced to build a small diner next to the coal yard fence which i named Coalyard Andy 's after Andy Fusco , my friend and donor of the cadaver diner that i performed surgery on . i was able to incorporate " Nighthawks " inside the diner . <p> Pardon the poor quality photos ; i ca n't seem to get used to digital photography since retiring my old Leica , <p> jackson <p> jackson , CEO , Not-So-Great Eastern RR , aka The Never Done Line <p> Division of the Southern Adirondack Railway Cartel 175852 @qwx375852 <p> John Armstrong 's " Modeling a mood - How to use fine art principles to make our model scenes more effective " along with his photos was republished in " Detailing Tips and Techniques " from Model Railroader Magazine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

I started counting the vertical rows of " rivets " whenever I was looking for tender shells . IIRC , the 2046 has 6 rows while only 5 for the smaller shell . <p> There have been a few different outfits making reproduction shells for 2671/2046W tenders.I prefer the ones that Bob Geller had made . I do n't think he makes them any longer , but they are available . <p> IMHO , Modern era Lionel shells are a good fit too . Some of them have a baffle and a post @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in order for the shell to fit over the postwar whistle assembly . Other than that , I have not run across any that would not fit on a postwar 2046W chassis with whistle assembly . <p> I just looked at one of the shells I mentioned in an earlier post . It has " 2671W-6 " molded inside of the rectangle and " 1993 " , which appears to be white paint , above the rectangle . This is the shell that lacks height clearance for a postwar whistle . It also lacks a road name though that location is smooth for decal application . <p> Also note with modern era Lionel 2046 type tender shells that the square cut-out behind the coal pile has been filled , and this was the air intake for the whistle . If left intact no , or very weak whistle sound . Just the motor sound . The ones TRW shows would not be a good candidate unless some cutting and filing surgery first . 175854 @qwx375854 175853 @qwx375853 <h> Block 175862 @qwx375862

The major changes in detail and operation happened with the intro of the PS2 examples , only improved upon by the more robust PS3 electronics . Hands down , the PS3 version is highly recommended over the earlier problematic ones . I actually enjoy it over the recent VL GG1 for its flawless performance , less finicky by far . Being half the price does n't hurt either . I also have the PS2 and PS3 versions of the traditional sized GG1 , with working pans on the latter .

Both have been reset to factory defaults by MTH Service Tech and they are still not right .

Many folks forget the PS-2 5V G motor was produced with operating pans . These have been great runners for me . I run live catenary like the real G motors . <p> I make my statements from first hand knowledge as a multi GG-1 owner and as an MTH tech . Under no circumstances is the G a problem . Being an MTH tech , I am not going to comment on what the better G motor was . They are all good . <p> I have many MTH G motors and about the same in Williams converted to PS-2 . <p> Rick , that makes no sense . Was the MTH service tech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> I run the wheels off . My layout operates every day . I have many locomotives in wall cases . They get swapped out with what is on the tracks .

I have 2 MTH and the VL 4800 . The first was a Proto1 which I upgraded to PS2 . The second is PS2 with operating pans . I never found either to be problematic ; always smooth , strong pullers .

I remember them and had one of the first issued that was brass and really nice . Green 5 stripe and did n't have flywheels but was a smooth runner anyway . It had a subtle elegance that really impressed me at the time . Wish I had hung onto it and had it updated with command &amp; sound ... <p> Bruce , any 5V is an issue with a bad battery . I still have two 5V G motors running about . I use nothing but the green MTH battery and they still run . That is a situation that the fault falls on the owner and not the G motor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know what engines are a pita and which engines stand tall . The MTH G motor is one of the best running engines ever made . If it was a bad engine , I would not have as many as I do . Guys , that may not be many due to the fact I am older and have been to 74 York shows . I see close to 450 locomotives each year ( all makes ) on my bench and feel very strongly the MTH G is not a problem . IF they were , you would see them on the sale boards . <p> Sam , the MTH GG-1 tooling was new .

The Remote Commander ( RC ) will only run one engine and that one engine has to be reset with the full DCS system in order to operate with the RC . Some newer PS3 engines can be reset with the RC , but no PS2 engines have that feature . <p> The DCS system and TMCC/Legacy operate perfectly together . I would just go for the full DCS system , I have both Legacy and DCS on my layout and enjoy them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the signal distribution , correct ? <p> Not much , really . <p> To add a DCS TIU to an existing layout one just inserts the TIU in the wires between the transformer and the tracks . The only other thing that I 'd recommend is that , if the transformer does n't already have effective short-circuit protection built-in , add a 10 amp fast-blow fuse ( or an equivalent . fast-tripping circuit breaker ) in the Hot wire between each transformer output and each TIU channel input . <p> If you have any DCS signal problems due to the existing wiring , they can easily be addressed , typically with a minimum amount of effort . <p> This and a whole lot more about DCS is all in MTH 's The DCS Companion 3rd Edition !

IMO , it is n't that difficult , but I really started from scratch on my current so I did n't have existing wiring to contend with . <p> I would recommend one of Barry 's books though , there is a TON of good info in those and after the initial purchase it will be referred to for many years to come .

I made 2 Lionel risers wider so the wider foot of the top set would fit on the top width of the lower ones . , I filled the middle with styrene sheets butted flush to the lionel girder work , retaining the look well . Then stacked them on square plastic tube I had found that same day while walking the dog around the block . <p> I just checked . The ho trailers do n't  have a gutter lip for the cranes jaws .

I took this from another member long ago and thought it helpful : <p> Rick 175852 @qwx375852 <p> I use them . One draw back as mentioned is that they are slightly smaller .

Yes , they are slightly smaller but to me the real drawback is the lack of facial features and the unrealistic colors of the clothes . With some painting and dullcote they can be useful in background , crowd and interior scenes but are n't even close to the quality of Arttista , Woodland Scenic 's Scenic Accents or even MTH . So , yes , you get what you pay for . <p> The standing people are small for O scale and probably worth it if you 're modeling a depot and need a crowd inside . <p> But they make a bag of seated people and those work great for passenger cars !

The smaller they get , the less ' real ' they look , but the same can be said for any element of any model . <p> While I agree that the Chinese figures in this thread would hardly make for a realistic scene and could indeed detract from one , the very idea that any figures doing so is laughable . <p> Seriously , this figure detracts from this scene ?

But , like all of the finer items , price goes up and you could end up spending a heck of a lot of money on figures , many of which would garner little attention . I agree with Lee that figures add " life " to scenes . I believe that the key to some of the finest layouts have great vignettes that tell a story .

She did a great job and they definitely look like the people in the photographs . So on my layout , I have my daughters , my son and his wife , my two sisters , my one brother-in-law , my two nieces , myself , and my golden retriever , Ranger .

Do n't get me wrong , I still got good photos and had fun on this RDC trip .

The shop tour made up for the crowd issues at photo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Would have been nice to meet you which would have been an easier process if they had n't sold every seat . True photo charters limit the number of patrons so there is room for everyone and their gear plus we can move around . The one I was on in the Twin Cities this past weekend had about 30 photographers spread out over two passenger cars which is typical . In all fairness the RBMN RDC trip was only $40 which included a lunch . The photo charters I usually go on do cost more but is a more satisfying experience - get a full day plus a night photo session out of it . Plus a good number of us patrons know each other from previous charters so it 's a friendly fun time for all on such trips . <p> Did you use a film camera before the DSLR ? If yes , making the transition should n't be too hard . Shooting in overcast conditions can be a challenge - my Canon DSLR has a ' Live View ' feature where you can see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the picture is taken which has come in quite handy for me . Can also take a test shot beforehand , view it and once any adjustments are made to the settings delete the test shot . That 's the cool thing about digital - being able to see the results on the spot as opposed to a week or more later as was typical in the film days . Lack of sun is an advantage at times since one can shoot a different angle that normally would be shadowed with sun . <p> Thanks for replying , yes I am fairly new to both organized photo charters and DSLR photography . For over 20 years , I used Nikon manual SLR cameras ( Models FE , FG , FM ) and a variety of fixed and telezoom lenses , combined with K-25/64 slide film , and the Fuji Velvia after K-64 died .

The front of the engine would go over it fine but when the back of the engine went over it then it would stop . We have tried many different suggestions including changing the track from a switch to the crossover to taking the crossover out and trying a piece of track in its place . Even when the track is there and not the cross over the engine still stops in that place . Could it be the track pins ( insulated pins ) not in the right place ? <p> The crossover is powered by 1 transformer and all 4 sides are getting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and uses 2 transformers . Both are Lionel Zw 's . <p> Problem 2 ... <p> Up until last night the Lionel powermaster which my dad has 2 worked fine and now they do not respond to the cab 1 . Is there a way to be able to reset them or get them to respond to the cab 1 ? <p> When we noticed it was not working correctly we would try to turn off the power to the transformer by the cab 1 and the light on the switch would not go out , engines would not respond and the 9 1 1 engine would only go backwards . No horn or bell . <p> Sorry for the long post but I was trying to give as much information as possible . I 'm not at my dad 's house now but will try to provide pictures later today or this evening . <p> Well , having just worked with some of this track and the switches 5121 and 5122 with the big bases , the control rail pins for the non-derail should be on the inside rails @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ V <p> The other power district isolation pins should be on the center rails . You only need the U for common everywhere as they are tied together internally in the ZW . <p> I also used a 90- , so nothing tricky about that . I would suspect a dead center rail away from the cross and the second roller of the engine on the plastic center of the cross . <p> I would suggest to solve track power with a meter using continuity and no power and then deal with the powermaster communication issue . 175852 @qwx375852 <p> Yes I seems like when the engines back trucks goes over the crossing that is when it stops . Also we took the crossing off last night and put a reg piece of track on where the crossover would go and it did the same thing . <p> I sent the 90 cross off to a friend with his layout . it looks like the pin arrangement is the cause . If there is a pin on the center rail of the cross the rail is dead between there and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do surgery on the bottom of across to isolate one line from the other . The four center rails of the cross are connected together . I suppose you could move the pins to the N-S sides of the cross and remove them from the switches to isolate N-S from E-W . But then the engine would momentarily be on the other power district when a roller was on a cross rail and the back roller on the second power district . Not good . <p> Take a pic of the bottom of the cross - I am thinking it 's riveted and would be a pain to open up . Separating the 4 center rails into N-S and E-W will most likely fix the problem . I do n't think the pins will work . 175852 @qwx375852 <p> I can not tell which need to be separate power districts from the layout photos . <p> If you want to keep the two on separate transformers or throttle handles at the cross , cut where you see the lines with x and solder a jumper wire across . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eliminated and the two line will cross physically , but be separated electrically . If you are isolating the line at the switch turnout from the thru , it should work ok . <p> The pins in the center rail will separate the track in between two of them from the power of the rest of the track . <p> The pins for a switch , like that of K-line in the photo , are for the outside rails to operate the switch control rails for non- derail action . See instruction sheet for correct placement . I only have Lionel instructions . <p> The cross jumper wire should be soldered to the tabs where I drew the red line . The cut separates all four center rails in two still and two disconnected . The jumper wire connect the two separated tabs . This separate power of N-S and E-W to enable to separate transformers or handles to control track that crosses . <p> I would suggest to solve track power with a meter using continuity and no power and then deal with the powermaster communication issue . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lamp connected to test leads . Measuring voltages without a load sometimes gives false readings .

Measuring voltages without a load sometimes gives false readings . Sometimes happens with resistance readings what appears OK breaks down under voltage conditions . <p> Just a thought . <p> I find quite the contrary - resistance readings are a good indication that voltage will travel on the circuit - it 's amperage , like a pulmor motor or two , when it will not predict a breakdown . <p> My dad is running mostly in conventional thur the Lionel powermaster with the option to run in command Tmcc control . <p> Basically when my dad bought the Mth 9 1 1 Railing engine we found out that when it went over the crossover it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the same thing happened . We have had the crossover for aleast 10 years and now having the problem . <p> I will try your suggestions and thank you again for your help . I will keep you posted on the progress . Have a great day . <p> I just find it curious that it did n't act up until you ran a modern engine . Glad to hear you have it worked out . <p> If you follow the setup and troubleshooting tips in the instruction manual you should be able to get the powermaster working . <p> Trying to run pulmor motors with it may require setting the stall voltage . That 's starts the voltage up in the 5-7 volt range . The modern engines with electronic e-units do n't need that much voltage to get going . <p> I know it is hard to believe but we have never had a problem with the crossover until my Dad bought the MTH 911 engine . He has 1 other MTH engine and it worked fine .... <p> Now to the powermasters ... In the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give a few suggestions . I also have the manual for the powermaster and tried to reset them to the factory setting . I 've looked at the troubleshooting section and tried there suggestion also but they are still not working ... Both were working fine until the crossover problem started . <p> When powered the green light comes on and acting like it is ready . The switches are in the run and con mode . When the red knob is turned the Red light then blinks but it is different on both sides . I will say side A and B. <p> Side A ----- When track power is turned on by a toggle switch it is on full power even tho the powermaster should be no power until the red knob is turned . <p> Side B---- When track power is turned on to the track is getting little power and will not turn off all the way . Also if you put a engine on the track it will only go backwards and you can not sound the horn or bell . <p> Again they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help me with this as we really want to use the Cab 1 for operational . <p> One simple point is that the TMCC Command base should be off when you want to operate in conventional mode . <p> I still have concerns about the insulating pin placement for the switches . Do you have the instructions ? They are K-line correct ? I finally found the manual online to confirm which are the control rails for non-derail. ( see attached ) <p> Another concern is track wiring or the power and control connections . Can you sketch a diagram of the power configuration ? if you are trying to toggle between a transformer with handles and a powermaster configuration , that could be where the issue lies . <p> I still do n't have a grasp of the track plan . <p> I read the other post and it still sounds like the wiring is crossed somewhere . <p> Carl <p> Arctic Railroad 175852 @qwx375852 <p> If you replace the 90 degree crossing with a straight track and the engine stops there must be a track issue where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long and scattered I could n't find if the locomotive did it in both directions at the same spot . In any case , if one truck is on regular track when it stops , it will most likely be the track , either no common in one of the rails , or no center rail power . <p> My guess is this has two dummy wheels , two rubber tired wheels , and two metal flanged wheels per truck leaving you just four wheels to make common ground contact and if two are on the plastic crossing you are left with just two . Without seeing an actual verified wiring diagram I 'm not sure anyone can help . A blown TMCC Powermaster will pass full voltage no matter where the slide switch is. 175854 @qwx375854 175853 @qwx375853 <h> Block 175862 @qwx375862

But I have started a adventure into 2 rail P48 modeling . And my first project is a Atlas SD35 I am working on that I wanted to post over here to get it in the right forum . <p> Goals for it are as follows . <p> P48 wheelsets from NWSL(ordered) <p> Truck side frames narrowed <p> New brake hangers and sandlines . <p> Correct speed recorder cable . <p> All new correct diameter hand rails and grabs , lift rings etc . <p> Etched radiator grills . <p> Scratch built wiper blades , New cab Windows and door handles etc . <p> New sandfiller hatches . <p> Correct the fuel tank profile and all new fuel gauges , filler neck , vent pipes and associated details . <p> And much , much more . Pics are of what I have done to this point . I work long weeks ( 70 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But having a log will keep me motivated hopefully . <p> The start . Took me several months to find it . <p> After milling the fuel tank and starting the frame rails <p> Needed some new air tanks . Scratch built out of rod and tube . Turned on a poor man 's lathe ( drill chucked in a vice ) <p> The correct tank profile with new styrene end sheets laminated on . Along with assorted plates according to prototype photos <p> Tonight 's small project . Etched brass grills I have been piecing together . In these pics the grills are simply pressed on over the stock grills . So they do not sit where they should . But as a proof of concept I am quite pleased so far . They will be three pieces each when finished to add depth . <p> You can also see I replaced the horn and all of the lift rings . As well as started fuel tank detailing . <p> All comments , good or bad welcome . I will flesh this post out some more when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's gon na look awesome , I have no doubt .

Opinions RDUNN III ? <p> I have been looking at the CLW drives that show up on eBay . With the later disign engineered plastic gear boxes . With a custom bolister and some mods to the frame I think they could be made to work quite well . Opinions RDUNN III ? <p> Remember CLW went out of business about 15 years ago . So , to me , the age of the plastic is questionable . I personally prefer the all metal gears , gear boxes and bearings of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sideframes are not sprung and from personal experience trying making them such is an almost impossible task and that is the thing that matters . One reason I eagerly await the Sunset PAs is to use the drives/chassis under some Lionel shells I been waiting years to 2-rail that are not being done by Sunset . <p> One of the reasons I no longer generally buy Atlas diesels is that machining the die cast chassis to fit the drive you suggest is a real PITA . Contrarily , one of the reasons I have some Atlas U23Bs including a couple I am converting to B23-7s is because the Trainman diesels have a stamped steel chassis that is much easier to replace for a horizontal drive . Now I just need to come up with sprung truck frames . Overland made brass diesels with both types of trucks so they are out there just few and far between and expensive . <p> But , and this is the important bit , as you stated your doing this for the challenge and in that go for it ! You will learn a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've been there and done that . <p> And PD Hobbies Blomberg trucks for those U23Bs that had them makes that transformation even easier . <p> I was curious about the U23B 's too . Chessie had a few . Knowing it 's easier to swap in the P and D drive is a big push to pick one up . The prices are right . And thanks for the info on the CLW drives . Had not considered age on the plastics . Given the issues I have had on my weaver RS3 drive and the non aged plastic gears . It 's a very valid point . And Given the limitations of the atlas truck blocks , I will do the P48 conversion on it and see how it runs . Worst comes to worst I suppose it will make a fine shelf piece . <p> I have been looking for a Red caboose GP9 kit too . That combined with the aftermarket frame and P and D trucks/drive componts should make a fun project . <p> I am sure I will run into many issues along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have some projects that simply wo n't work . But I look forward to it . <p> Started the trucks . The big issue I have with the stock trucks is the side frames are much too far from the wheel sets . Causing the brake shoes to not be located correctly in relation to the wheel treads . So I initially planned on using the factory truck side frame mounts and just relocate the holes in the side frame castings . Nope . Too much play . So I built my own mounts using brass stock and promptly screwed up the hole locations so after much colorful language that I shall not repeat here . I figured a way to engineer a some sloppy fitment into the side frames . And drilled and tapped everything to assemble and pray it lined up . And it did , so far . Now on to modifying the truck blocks . Ugh , get the feeling I am gon na screw something else up but here we go . <p> Pic so far . <p> So many trains ... so little time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So got angry finishing up the last hole for the bolister . Ca n't get it perfectly aligned . Chucked some stuff , muttered and cussed . Wife asked what was wrong , I got up and moped into the living room and told her I am sick of trying to get holes perfectly straight and need a drill press . She just looked at me and said " so buy one " wham ! Just like that I thought why not ? So , I just ordered a drill press , a table vise for said press and about a half trillion machine screws in various lengths to finish this project before I lose the will to live . Should be here Wednesday , yay ! So excited . Do n't know why I did n't do this earlier . Updates will follow on next day off- which happens to be Thursday <p> Oh and another thing coming up too . Moving back to Oregon in June . Looking at houses now ... found one with a layout room of about 20x35 feet . So hopefully no more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Mexico artsy fartsy living in a couple months . Yay ! Gon na get the wife to buy me a lathe for my birthday when we get back there ... she just does n't know it yet ... <p> So . Got bored with the SD35 . Trucks will have to be replaced to convert it properly to P48 . So while waiting for a set of trucks to pop up I bought a new in box RedCaboose GP9 kit to mess with . I am ordering the P and D conversion kit for it in a week or two . Protocraft bolister conversion and Steve grobowski ( sp ? ) Wheel sets along with a finescale360 frame . It should be a fun project . It will be a semi freelanced build based loosely on this unit . <p> And the model <p> All of my three rail stuff will be going up for sale this week too . So it should be a fun build and should go quickly once I source all the parts . Will update as I go <p> So many trains ... so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Carefully with that brass wire . its very ameable and delicate .

Both have switches and chuggers in them but I have no idea what wire goes where . Admittedly , even if wired up I do n't know if they 're gon na work .

" <p> I have one but its not on my PC here at work . Basically , the chugger mounts to the frame which is a grounding point .

One lead from this switch goes to the chugger unit , the other goes to the switch in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wired to a hot lead from the motor pick up . That motor pick up lead goes to one of the screw terminals on an early reverse unit or an alternate point with a modern reverse unit .

You can cut power to the chugger to stop said noise by flipping the switch in the cab and cutting power to the circuit . Chuggers are available , the reed switches are very scarce . 175852 @qwx375852 <p> Okay , the chugger does have two contacts , one for hot and one for ground , I 've never seen one grounded to frame through the bracket . <p> There are three components , the chugger coil , the leaf switch ( triggered by the axle cam ) and the switch in the cab . <p> First I 'd check the coil for function ( does it buzz when power is applied ) , the cab switch ( is it all intact ) and the leaf switch ( are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all looks good you can begin wiring it .

The leaf switch usually has a short piece of wire attached to one strip which is then wrapped around the switch mounting bracket screw in order to ground it out . <p> As stated , the coils and cab switches are available but the leaf switches are not . If your leaf switch is damaged , it may be possible to repair it or replace it with a modern micro switch . On my 400E , one of the copper strips was broken .

On the 151 signal you want to connect the common to the 153IR common , the power for the light bulb to the hot terminal , and the coil that makes the arm go down to the normally open contact . Connected like this the light in the signal will be on all the time and the arm will go down to the red position when the train goes by the IR device and will stay down as long as you have the time delay set for . " <p> The problem I 'm having is that when the blade goes down , the light goes out . It does look like there may have been re-wiring of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with blade up , and no light when blade down . <p> It sounds like you connected the common wire from the 151 signal device to the n/c ( normally closed ) contact on the 153 IR controller instead of the actual common terminal on the 153 IR controller ? <p> When the controller is activated it would break the lights connection if it was on the N/C connection . How are you powering the 153 IR ? Track power or accessory power ? 3 wires is easy unless you have eyes like I do ......... <p> Chuck Sartor at " O'nly " 3rail would have it as would Brasseur . Stretching it may be a Band-Aid , but it would not have the proper tension . <p> I have had to work on some old solenoid switches ( like 29 of them ) in the last few months . I put a small spritz of the radio-shack tuner cleaner/lube on the solenoid piston . Do n't know if it helps or not , but they certainly slide real nice . <p> Some progress , some not . I now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am still having difficulty getting the blade to work while the light bulb is on . I can easily have it work with the light going off when the blade is down , but that is not the full operation . Looking at page 15 in the 153IR controller manual , it shows multi-wire accessories , using a relay and a diode . I wonder , is the 151 considered a " multi-wire accessory ? " <p> If there is someone out there who has a working 151 off their 153IR without other relays or diodes , would they post and show the wiring , and the operation ? <p> Now , when I do this : the center common on the 151 signal goes to the ACCPWR , light goes to ACCGND , and semaphore solenoid goes to NO , I can hear the 153IR " clicking " when activated , but no blade motion . Yet , if I connect the blade to ACGND , the blade goes down steady and stays down , as one would think . <p> OK , in the words of Roseanne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The original post was correct : <p> " On the 153 IR , I believe the output has four connections , hot , common , normally open ( NO ) and normally closed ( NC ) .

I have 170 ft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this . ( yes I measured it up ! ) <p> In regards to the question I had on the state of the switches being know directly by the switch itself -- and then the question about running PDI wiring between switches ... <p> I was assuming the state would be made available on the PDI bus in some manner . Whether that meant a PDI plug into the switch , a plug into a LCS device box per switch or an RF signal in some form to a magic box on the PDI bus , or some other means .... I had n't really considered but I also had n't considered going outside the framework/architecture of LCS for the info . <p> Well I think this overlaps the STM2 monitor now ... that 's either on my xmas list or I have it and I 've yet to get around to putting it up .... so my experience is limited . <p> But perhaps these can get confused and indicate the wrong state at times ... <p> So in the end it seems simpler , more reliable and all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be able to transmit it onto the PDI bus directly in some manner . <p> I ca n't think of any reason to not be willing to string PDI wire between switches except for the standard pragmatic issues of length and cost of the wiring . <p> Likewise I can see that there might be a ERR path to an upgrade perhaps here too ... that might be nice ... save the old switches sort of thing ... <p> Still back to main question , I suppose if in theory it were an RF link per switch to/from the magic box next to the LCS wifi unit which is hidden under the table ... ok , yeah that 'd be kinda cool at first blush -- save a bit of stringing wire and all that .... <p> But hey you know , if I 'm stringing wire between switches for the PDI bus -- maybe it can supply power to my switches too ... there could be an upside there to that approach if it were possible . <p> I know one of the questions was about connecting the STM2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ topics on this forum about this . I worked with a couple forum members to get this to work , so if you already have them you can still use them . Here is the wiring diagram I developed . I have successfully got this to work via Cab-2 , LCS App , and so forth . <p> What you need to use is a DZ-1008A relay . Please note that this diagram does n't show anti-derail hooked-up , but just follow the wiring diagram from Z-stuff . <p> Chris <p> TCA , LCCA 175852 @qwx375852 <p> And every one else involved here , a big thanks for the recording and info from the meeting .

@@36015379 @5015379/ <p> How do I start my PW engine and increase speed ? IE. , Pressing the Boost Button I 'm at full throttle . Direction button does not work ...... I have to turn on and off to set direction . My goal , after selecting Track #1 , is to simply operate in conventional mode . Lionel instructional manual for the Legacy Powermaster does not appear to offer these steps for Conventional Mode . <p> UPDATE : Pressing TR , 1 , SET : I 'm able to power up .

@@36015383 @5015383/ <h> Combining 27 " curves and 42 " curves <p> I 'm contemplating an elevated level on my new layout , a U-pattern , with 180-degree turnarounds at each end of the " U " . <p> I 've used O27 tubular track on the main layout but am not limited to it for the elevated level though I have plenty of it . Space allows me 4 options for the turnarounds : ( 1 ) 27 " curves with some straights ; ( 2 ) a mix of 27 " and 42 " curves where I 'd go 42-27-42-27 ; ( 3 ) Marx 34 " curves that I do n't currently have but could likely find ; or ( 4 ) 36 " curves using Fastrack . <p> I 've never used curves of different radii back-to-back , but this option appears to be ideal for me . I like to put Johnson Rubber roadbed below my curves rather than trying to bend foam roadbed , and I have plenty of 27 " and 42 " roadbed curves to go with my tubular track . <p> Any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limit the elevated to engines and rolling stock that navigate 27 " curves . <p> I have found that the different curve sizes in 027 can make it difficult to make a half circle or partial circle , may need some half track curve sections or have to cut the curved track to fit . If you stay with one size curve it is much easier to work with . <p> I have used 027 half curves to work with engines that need a higher radius curve ; one half curve track then one half straight and again a half curve , repeat it through out the curved area . <p> Lee Fritz 175859 @qwx375859 <p> You are on the verge of creating a spiral easement : 042-027-027-042 approximates the way real RRs make curves by easing into them . The whole thing looks much more natural than a plain straight-to-curve , even if the plain curve is of a larger diameter ( and I wish I had room for easements ) . <p> To make an end loop you are turning 180 degrees . When combining different diameter curves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make a smooth curve . <p> The amount you turn in degrees for each full track section depends on the number of sections that make up a circle in that diameter . It does n't really depend on the diameter itself , just the number of sections that make a circle <p> For example , if 8 sections of track make a circle then each piece is 45 degrees and each half-section is 22.5 degrees <p> 12 sections to a circle ----&gt; each piece is 30 degrees and each half is 15 degrees . <p> 16 sections to a circle ------&gt; each piece is 22.5 degrees and each half is 11.25 degrees <p> If your curves do n't add up to exactly 180 for each half circle , you will not have a complete half circle and smooth curves . That is why you often end up cutting track when making hybrid curves . Luckily ( or maybe by design ! ) even with all the different diameter curves available , most fall into 8 , 12 or 16 per circle , simplifying things for the layout builder . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a certain curvature , even one piece of track with a curve tighter than that might cause problems . Just as " a chain is only as strong as its weakest link " , so , too , to an engine going around a loop , " a curve is only as wide as its tightest curve section " . <p> Maybe you mis-typed your 2nd option of " ( 2 ) a mix of 27 " and 42 " curves where I 'd go 42-27-42-27 " . Two of the 42s with the two 27s would leave you 30 degrees short . <p> Your final comment with the extra 42 at the end would work well . I do it all the time . <p> Yeah , I left out a 42 in the first .... I often think faster than I can type . <p> Agree with Jim 's comment above that I 'd be limited to engines rated for 27 " curves ( chain as good as the weakest link ) but I think I can live with that . Most of my engines are rated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nothing bigger than that . My 31 " min. curve engines are ones I 'd rather not put on an elevated level for fear of breakage . Thinking I 'd run a few cheaper ones on the elevated level that , if they tumbled , I would n't lose a lot of sleep or value . <p> I combined different curves like that wih Standard and O guge but as I have up graded my layout track I have eliminated them . The trains do n't look right going through such a curve . Especially a tight curve-they whip through the curve and not a very prototypical action . But if you need it to complete your trackage-do it . <p> Hey it will work ! My layout is all O27 track but the main loop has no 27 " curves , the smaller loops do . The outer main loop does have a big mix of Lionel O42 , O54 , and K-line O72 with a 1/2 circle of Marx O34 . Works fine , Do n't be afraid . Nice thing about using the smaller curves is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs wider curves . The neat thing about tubular track is you can cut and fit it to anything you like . Try that with Fastrack . <p> Hey it will work ! My layout is all O27 track but the main loop has no 27 " curves , the smaller loops do .

Not all the detail of a scale , but terrific toy train layout . <p> I wish I had that much space , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it down and move up into a spare bedroom and am limited to 8'x11 ' . I 've got 54 " curves on the outside loop and 42 " and 34 " in the inner loop . Had to go with basic loops around my operating yards . For the elevated , though , I want a more interesting circuit , but ca n't avoid using some 27 " curves to accomplish what I want to do . <p> Just to throw something else out there , Menards offers O36 curves in track that matches the profile of traditional O track . While not a match to O27 profile , it looks fairly similar . With some finagling you can get traditional O and O27 to match up fairly well as well . <p> JGL <p> $ This is John Galt live for mine . " <p> If you have the track handy , why do n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's five or six pieces of track . Would probably take less than five minutes ( two ? ) to put together then run some cars around it . That is the only way to know if you like it anyhow . This thread has been going on for three days . <p> You can always put a straight to fit in the middle to widen the diameter as well . O27 with a nine inch straight equals 36 " . I think it does anyway . <p> Chiming back in : I agree with GG1MAN 's comment about consistency in the curve diameters . 42-27-42-27-42 does work and I actually did that one year on my Christmas layout only to tear it out and redesign the u-turn . The train sort of " jerks " around the curve if you can picture that . Not because of mechanical constraints but because is glides thru a nice 42 " curve and then changes course thru the 27 making a sharper turn , etc . <p> Watched your video . Great job on the layout .
