Cheers ! <p> On May 31 , 2017 at 2:34 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for First Quarter of 2017 May 30 , 2017 <p> Brian Lock , CEO , comments , " Despite lower production in Q1 of 2017 compared to Q1 of 2016 , operating cash flows increased significantly from Q1 2016 . Even though the Company sold slightly fewer ounces in Q1 of 2017 compared to Q1 of 2016 , a decrease in gold inventories and higher average realized prices , compared with Q1 last year , were primary factors in the increase in operating cash flow . <p> Based on the Companys updated mine plan , the Company currently anticipates mining of gold at Mineral Ridge through August 2017 . Due to permitting timelines , the Company anticipates production of gold at Mineral Ridge to be 20 25,000 ounces through to August 2017 from the Mary LC , Brodie and Bluelite south pits . The Custer pit and other areas for which permitting is outstanding , are not included in this production estimate and will be evaluated for economics of associated mining timelines when permits are received . There can be no assurances that , when the permits are received , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it is not economically viable to do so . Total cash costs are expected to be $1,050 $1,100 per ounce of gold sold . This increase in costs is due to the projected lower production level in 2017 while fixed costs remain relatively constant . <p> The 2017 mine plan calls for an average daily production rate of 11,500 tonnes which includes an average of 1,798 tonnes of ore delivered to the crusher on a daily basis over the 226 scheduled mining days . The decreased metal production in Q1 of 2017 is attributed to reduced mining rates , somewhat offset by higher grade and favorable leach pad recoveries . <p> Proposed exploration activities for 2017 , which are dependent on the Companys finances , are intended to include geological mapping , geophysical surveying , sampling and drilling activities at Mineral Ridges Drinkwater pit , North Springs , Tarantula and Eagle Canyon areas , as well as at the Orleans and the Goldwedge properties . Also included in the proposed exploration activities is an evaluation of potential unrecovered mineralization of the Mineral Ridge leach pad with a view to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recover additional gold mineralization . " <p> ( SGN ) is at a very interesting place , where they have a number of balls up in the air and nobody knows which ones will land . <p> Most pressing is their end of mine life on several of their pits coming up in August for the Mineral Ridge mill . The upside is that they have a number of other feeder pits they are working to get Custer permitted to feed that mill , as well as drilling and exploration to extend the mine life on Mineral Ridge . However , those are still wildcards at present and there are no guarantees . It seems the continued selloff is due to this uncertainty . <p> In addition , there is more potential upside in that Scorpio Gold is exploring using the old tailing material to fee the mill . My buddy @MadeOfRubber just got an update from the CEO yesterday and he had this to say : <p> " The samples for the heap leach pad drilling were submitted to Kappes Cassiday for metallurgical testing and we expect to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ update the market shortly thereafter .

I 'm still constructive on Scorpio Gold but at this point its a waiting game to see what permits they get , if they do a capital raise for drilling , if their assays from the Tailings will be recoverable , and how the toll milling goes . <p> I 've also been deploying some funds to their neighbors West Kirkland Mining .

All followed by a review of the new movie , " The Silence " <p> I have to say that I am unfamiliar with " Campaign for Working Families " , but I did find the list of Obamas recent pardons to be thought provoking. - Any opinions ? - Big Al <p> Wednesday , January 18 , 2017 <p> To : Friends &amp; Supporters <p> From : Gary L. Bauer <p> Obamas Shame <p> Lame duck President Barack Obama has been working harder in recent weeks than he has in the past eight years . He has been busy attempting to delegitimize the election of Donald Trump and undermining the national security of the United States . He hit a new low yesterday when he commuted the sentence of Bradley/Chelsea Manning . <p> As you may recall , Manning stole and leaked more than 700,000 national security documents and handed them over to Wikileaks , which posted the information online . What Manning stole was so important that Osama bin Laden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war strategy in Afghanistan and Iraq . <p> The Taliban publicly stated that it would use the information to hunt down informants . <p> Manning was charged with 22 crimes , including aiding the enemy , which carries the death penalty . He pled guilty to ten charges , was convicted on several others and sentenced to 35 years in prison . Thanks to Obama , Manning will be released in May after serving just seven years . <p> In recent weeks , Donald Trump has been pilloried by the left and even some on the right for supposedly not respecting the men and women in the intelligence community who risk their lives to protect us . Barack Obama just slapped the intelligence community in the face . <p> Think about this for a moment . During last years presidential campaign , Obama and the Democrats directed a lot of vitriol at Wikileaks for exposing John Podestas emails and messages from the Democratic National Committee . Those emails were a mixture of gossip and embarrassing political commentary . <p> Almost every day since the election we have been told that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There has been an effort to undermine Trumps legitimacy . Sanctions were imposed on Russia . Multiple investigations are underway . <p> The documents Manning released were not gossip . They involved the national security secrets of the United States of America . Even CNNsJake Tapper was shocked by the blatant contradiction involved in commuting Mannings sentence . <p> The DNC leak is insignificant compared to the gaping wound that Manning struck to the body of U.S. national security . With this one act , Barack Obama has shown the total hypocrisy of the hair-on-fire controversy we were subjected to regarding John Podestas emails . <p> Every congressman and senator who expressed such grave misgivings about whether Russia was involved in the DNC leaks should be outraged over what the president just did in giving a " get out of jail free card " to one of the most despicable characters in modern American history . <p> Reaction <p> The reaction to Obamas commutation of Mannings sentence was fierce and bi-partisan . " This is outrageous , " Speaker Paul Ryan said . " Chelsea Mannings treachery put American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensitive secrets . " <p> " Im stunned , " said Sen. John McCain ( R-AZ ) . " President Obamas commutation . . . is a grave mistake that I fear will encourage further acts of espionage and undermine military discipline . It also devalues the courage of real whistle-blowers . " <p> Sen. Joe Manchin ( D-WV ) told MSNBC , " I think its dead wrong . Absolutely dead wrong . . . This is treason . Espionage at the highest level . " Manchin went on to suggest that Obama was giving a " green light " to other hackers . <p> Sen. Bob Menendez ( D-NJ ) said , " At a time when we are seriously questioning what Russia did , as it relates to our recent elections and the role of Wikileaks , I 'm not sure what kind of message we send here . I 'm really surprised that the president took this action . " <p> And it is also being reported that Secretary of Defense Ash Carter opposed reducing Mannings sentence . <p> But Wait , Theres More ! <p> Obama also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Considered by the radical left to be a " political prisoner , " Lopez Rivera was a member of the F.A.L.N. , a Marxist terrorist group that was responsible for more than 100 bombings . <p> In 1981 , he was convicted on several charges , including seditious conspiracy and armed robbery , and sentenced to 55 years in jail . In 1988 , he got another 15 years for plotting to escape from Ft . Leavenworth . <p> Incredibly , Bill Clinton tried to free Lopez Rivera in 1999 , but he rejected Clintons terms for clemency , which included renouncing terrorism . What conditions , if any , did Obama demand ? <p> The political left is applauding the release of this terrorist . Weather Underground terrorist Bill Ayers was " dancing in the aisles " at the news . Lin-Manuel Miranda , creator of the Broadway hit " Hamilton , " tweeted yesterday , " Sobbing with gratitude here in London . OSCAR LOPEZ RIVERA IS COMING HOME . THANK YOU , @POTUS . " <p> Silence <p> My friends , I do n't  need to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many Christians around the world . According to a recent report , 2016 was the " worst year yet " for Christian persecution . But persecution has been a harsh reality for Christians ever since Christ was nailed to the Cross . <p> Silence , a new film appearing in theaters across the country , reveals the conditions Christians endured in 17th century Japan . The film follows two Catholic priests from Portugal as they travel to Japan in search of a missing mentor who was there to spread the faith . <p> I do n't  want to give away too much of the plot , but I will say that its a story of deep and persevering faith in the face of unthinkable persecution . The priests and the small communities of Japanese Christians they minister to are terrorized for their faith by a government that feared what Christianity would do if it got a foothold in the country . They realized how powerful the Good News was , especially for the poor and marginalized . <p> This is not a movie for young children . It shows in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is also a disturbing reminder of the persecution that is taking place today in many parts of the world . <p> That said , Silence is a beautiful film , with rich cinematography and stellar acting . It has already won several film awards , and its easy to see why . I recommend everyone go see it . <p> Every soldier , sailor and Airman is required to give an oath that they will preserve , protect and defend the Constitution against all enemies , foreign and domestic . <p> Manning not only lived up to that oath , she gave seven years of her life to expose criminal activity and lies on behalf of the government . <p> Manning deserves a medal as does Snowden . They both lived up to their original oath of office which is a lot more than I can say for the warmongers running the US . <p> The bible said not a word about " Blessed be the Warmongers " <p> With half of the prison population of the entire world , we have the wrong people locked up . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : <p> Even though were the minority on these pages , I agree wholeheartedly with your sentiments .

@@120399685 @9399685/ <h> Gold Market Commentary Tue 3 Jan , 2017 <h> How did gold and silver really do in 2016 and where are they headed this year ? <p> Here is a recap of the gold market by our friend Lawrie Williams . He brings up a lot of points that I agree with on the main drivers ( up and down ) for gold this year Trump , US market moves including a potential major drop and the USD . <p> . <p> Gold is , as usual , somewhat unpredictable. - Its performance in 2016 will have been very much dependent on the performance of your local currency vis-+ -vis the US dollar. - Even in the latter the actual year-end price is also dependent on location and timing. - For example year-end prices in US dollars in Shanghai , London and New York were sharply different " respectively US$1,185 , US$1,159 and US$1,151 based on the SGE final benchmark price for the year , the final LBMA gold price setting in 2016 and the final New York spot price . <p> We ca n't view SGE comparisons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benchmark prices back in April , but from the final LBMA price for 2015 to that in 2016 , gold rose 9.1% over the year. - In terms of New York prices gold rose a slightly smaller 8.5% over the year . On the other hand in Russian rubles the gold price FELL by 10.6% over the year as the ruble appreciated against the dollar after a very sharp fall in 2014/15. - On the other hand , in the Pound Sterling , the UK gold price rose 22.5% over the year ! - The Brexit vote effect ! <p> But , as far as the media is concerned it tends to be the US dollar price which is the only one which matters so let 's look at the prospects for the gold price in the year ahead in US dollars " and for the other precious metals as well . <p> While global geopolitics and economics all have an effect on the dollar price of gold , it will almost certainly be the US itself and the impact on it of the Trump Presidency 's policies which will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is perhaps as unpredictable as his performance through the runup to the election suggests then we could see some major domestic and foreign policy upsets in relation to what has gone before. - Trump 's stated policies on the US economy have proved popular with Wall Street , but may well not fly " at least not nearly as quickly as the general public might expect , or even at all. - This could all see a reversal in the seemingly inexorable advance of general equities and an about-turn by the Fed in terms of interest rate rises , both of which would likely see a boost in the gold price. - Indeed general equities could crash given that they look to be overbought and in most cases earnings do n't look sufficient to justify the high prices currently prevailing. - At some stage the stock price bubble will surely burst. - Some experts ' are predicting a crash of epic proportions " perhaps 80% -but although this is indeed possible we reckon that if there is a major correction ahead it will be more in the order of 50% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 55% at one time . <p> Should an equities market crash of this magnitude occur again , similarly to 2008 the gold price could be brought down sharply too as funds and investment houses struggle for liquidity and a fall to $1,000 or thereabouts would n't be out of the question but again , as in 2008/09 , gold would likely recover far faster than equities and then go from strength to strength as its safe haven role would become paramount again. - Where gold might end 2017 therefore could be a matter of timing. - If equities do n't crash , but perhaps correct by say 10-15% , then gold could well hit the $1,400 mark during the year. - If there is a major equities crash and it happens early in the year , gold could still hit the $1,400 mark " and steam on upwards in 2018 , but if there is an equities market crash , and it peaks in the final quarter of the year then gold could well end the period in a much weaker position " but still steam ahead in 2018 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the face of things , the likelihood of a rapprochement with President Putin 's Russia " if Congress allows this to take place. - The nomination of Rex Tillerson as Trump 's Secretary of State certainly suggests a change of relationships here , although it is yet possible that Tillerson 's nomination may be rejected by the Senate. - Trump may well be trying to take a leaf out of President Ronald Reagan 's book whose positive relationship with Russia 's Mikhail Gorbachev led to the end of the arms race , perestroika and effectively the end of the US/Russian stand-off , which now seems to be being resurrected by the current leaderships of two of the world 's three superpowers. - But while Trump may be heading towards a less hostile relationship with Russia , he also looks as though he may also be stirring up problems ahead with the third major superpower , China . <p> Domestic and foreign policy uncertainties may form the crux of a gold price resurrection in 2017. - This may already have started in 2016 , but big financial sector interventions from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even so gold was up around 8% over the year and silver an even higher 15%. - This was after being up respectively around 25% and 45% immediately after the US independence Day holiday " a turnaround date which saw inflows into the world 's largest gold ETF switch to major outflows ( See : GLD Drops 158 Tonnes Since Independence Day ) . - The referenced article looks at the seemingly pivotal impact of major holidays in the USA seemingly often providing the inflection points for complete changes in investment sentiment with respect to precious metals prices . <p> But , there 's little doubt that dollar strength will be important for the gold price and the prospects of a trade war with China and the unwinding of some other key trade agreements , which Trump appears to wish to implement , could be destabilising for the greenback. - It is also perhaps not in US interests for the dollar to appreciate further " the dollar index ( DXY ) is currently comfortably above 103 which is a new record having varied between 91 and 103 during 2016 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate rises too. - A high dollar makes US exports less competitive ( which is why so much US company manufacturing activity has moved offshore ) , and imports cheaper , which would be a further blow towards trying to balance the nation 's current account. - We suggest that , over the course of the year ahead , the Fed will move surreptitiously to bring the dollar index down to perhaps a level of around 95 , which is not conducive to further interest rate rises and which is gold positive . <p> While gold opened higher in early New Year trade , it rapidly lost ground , falling below the key $1,150 mark in Europe. - It remains to be seen how the US will react once markets open there. - But again , in 2016 , it opened the year weaker before surging upwards. - Will this year see a repeat ? <p> If we are correct in our assumptions about gold and we do see something of a repeat of 2016 , then silver will do even better. - The gold:silver ratio ( GSR ) has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when silver peaked in mid 2016 ( it had started the year near 80 and at one stage had risen to close to 84 ) but we think that if gold does perform then a GSR of around 65 could be seen again given silver tends to outperform gold in a rising gold scenario " and if gold hits $1,400 then silver could rise to over $21 , still a huge way short of the near $50 it hit back in 2011 before a massive price takedown . <p> So overall a positive view of the gold price in the year ahead and perhaps an even more positive one on silver , BUT if there is a general equities crash as many doom and gloom merchants are predicting ( and the uncertainties surrounding the Trump Presidency would perhaps make this even more likely ) then booth gold and silver could suffer heavily in the financial fallout. - The comfort here is that would likely not be as intense a fall as the equities market and the recovery would be far quicker .

Gold is not priced in the physical gold market where bullion is bought and sold . Gold is priced in a futures market where uncovered contracts that are settled in cash are bought and sold . As the futures contracts do not have to be covered in the way that shorting a stock has to be covered , the bullion bank agents of the central banks can create paper gold by printing naked contracts . In other words , it is possible to inflate the supply of gold in the market in which the gold price is determined by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in supply of paper gold drives down the futures price of gold . This Western policy is stupid , because it drives down the price of real gold for the major Asian purchasers " China , India , and Turkey . But the policy protects the value of the US dollar by preventing a rising gold price that would show the growing lack of confidence in fiat paper currencies . <p> The European , UK , and Japanese central banks have protected the US dollar 's exchange rate vis-a-vis other reserve currencies by indulging in quantitative easing themselves . With all fiat currencies inflating , the exchange rates stay relatively stable . The central banks prevent the rise in the price of gold by printing paper gold for the paper gold market . <p> It is my view that bitcoin is the beneficiary of this rigging of the prices of gold and fiat currencies . Bitcoin can not increase in supply , and bitcoins are not priced in future markets that permit naked shorts .

Well here we are today with a decimated oil price that should be having a hugely positive impact on the equities ( even with a lower commodity price ) and yet in my estimation there has been virtually no properly correlated benefit to the mining stocks based on this key fact .

I think CPI is going to have its little mini spike as of now and then decline back to somewhere near 2% by end of year .

Gold is not priced in the physical gold market where bullion is bought and sold . Gold is priced in a futures market where uncovered contracts that are settled in cash are bought and sold . As the futures contracts do not have to be covered in the way that shorting a stock has to be covered , the bullion bank agents of the central banks can create paper gold by printing naked contracts . In other words , it is possible to inflate the supply of gold in the market in which the gold price is determined by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in supply of paper gold drives down the futures price of gold . This Western policy is stupid , because it drives down the price of real gold for the major Asian purchasers " China , India , and Turkey . But the policy protects the value of the US dollar by preventing a rising gold price that would show the growing lack of confidence in fiat paper currencies . <p> The European , UK , and Japanese central banks have protected the US dollar 's exchange rate vis-a-vis other reserve currencies by indulging in quantitative easing themselves . With all fiat currencies inflating , the exchange rates stay relatively stable . The central banks prevent the rise in the price of gold by printing paper gold for the paper gold market . <p> It is my view that bitcoin is the beneficiary of this rigging of the prices of gold and fiat currencies . Bitcoin can not increase in supply , and bitcoins are not priced in future markets that permit naked shorts .

The interview is around an hour but well worth a listen . Chris Martenson and Steve St. Angelo discuss oil , debt , and precious metals in a big picture sense . <p> Any sense of prosperity in todays economy is based on a falsehood , claims Steve St. Angelo , proprietor of the- SRSrocco Report- website . <p> Like we here at PeakProsperity.com , Steve is a student of energy . He shares our worldview that net energy per capita has been in steady decline , and a result , future growth will be limited . Also like us , he notes that the " growth " seen over the past several decades has n't  been due to surplus net energy ( which makes being able to do more possible ) . Instead , it has been fueled by debt - which essentially steals prosperity from the future and consumes it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell you that kind of scam cant last forever . And it cant . Once the can ca n't be kicked any further and the next economic and/or financial crisis is upon us , Steve sees todays over-inflated asset prices quickly dropping by a gut-wrenching- 50-75% : <p> As the energy return on investment started to fall for the United States in the 1970s , we had to start- off-shoring our manufacturing as a way to extend the US lifestyle . We could n't afford the manufacturing anymore because of our oil energy return on investment . It moved over to other parts of the world where labor was cheaper . And we started buying more homes , more things , more stuff . And we went into debt to do that . That has extended the " leech and spend " US suburban economy . <p> If you look at it on face value it looks like this is continuing .

Its anyone 's guess how quickly they can fall , but according to what I have been looking at , I think we are going to see a 50% increase in real estate values right off the bat . I am not saying this will happen in a day , but the first wave will be a 30-50% decrease in real estate values when the markets really start to crack . They are already at the edge of the cliff and I see prices falling down the cliff , struggling to recover , and then falling even further . Actually , I predict within the next 5-10 years , we can easily see a 75% or more reduction in real estate values . <p> What does that mean for stocks and bonds ? The same thing .

We are continuing to see metals stocks sell off even with the gold an silver prices drifting higher . This is never a good sign but to focus on Avis number for GDX we will be watching 22.30 . While Avi is still bullish overall on the metals he has a similar time frame as us , late this year when the metals could really get going . Here is his full post <p> I was told a story today about another analyst who bought into a 3X leveraged ETF on Monday as the GDX was hitting its highs and the market was quite bullish , and then sold for a 10%+ loss yesterday as it was hitting its lows when the market turned very bearish. - Sadly , he and those following him were watching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think this is a good time to remind you of what one of our more astute members " Roy Prasad " has said about markets : <p> The goal of EW analysis is to analyze sentiment , not participate in it ! <p> I am also going to take this opportunity to remind you WHILE THE MARKET IS UP that most should not be using leveraged ETF 's or options until the heart of a major 3rd- wave is taking hold. - And , as I have also noted many times before , I do n't expect that to happen until later this year , assuming we are able to complete wave 1 within the next month or two back towards the August highs. - For those that had a hard time stomaching this recent pullback , please consider whether you are too heavily leveraged into this complex . <p> As you may remember from the weekend update I sent out to members at Elliottwavetrader.net , as long as we held over 21.60GDX on Monday , and completed 5 waves up , we could have a nice set up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However , even after we completed 5 waves up on Monday , yesterday , those that were overleveraged in the complex were certainly participating in the sentiment as we were hitting the lows toward the end of the day. - But , if you were able to maintain a reasonable perspective , you would have recognized that we had another 1-2 set up in place , which could lead to a 3rd- wave break out. - I wrote about it all day yesterday , and reiterated it this morning yet again. - Clearly , it was not an easy trade to take due to the depth of the wave 2 yesterday , but the pattern was a rather nice set up . <p> So , with today 's rally , the market has broken out of initial resistance. - However , we still need a larger degree 5 wave structure to complete before we can be much more confident of the fact that this rally is pointing us back towards the August highs again. - For now , we only have 3 waves up . <p> While the wave 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a day ) , the rule of alternation would suggest that the wave 4 will likely be a sideways grind for at least a day , which should maintain a high level consolidation. - That is what I will be looking for over the next day or two , followed by the completion of a 5-wave structure up towards the 23.50-24 region , ideally , with the potential to even extend up to 25 , which will complete wave ( i ) of ( 3 ) of 1 . <p> Alternatively , if the market is not able to complete a full 5 waves up , and we see the GDX break below 22.30 before we complete that 5 waves up , it would suggest that this rally is a b-wave rally in a larger wave ( 2 ) , but can still take us back towards the February high before we see a c-wave down back towards the region from which we just rallied , and maybe even a little lower . But , let 's take this one step at a time . <p> For now , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and allow the market to tell me if I need to change that perspective . <p> As far as silver and gold , both also have 3 waves up off the lows now. - But , silver has me a bit more concerned than gold right now. - Silver , as well as a couple of silver miners I was looking at , would suggest the bigger a-b-c alternative pattern I noted above may play out , and it is represented on the attached daily silver chart . - And , I want to reiterate that this is my alternative count . <p> As I have said so many times before , since we have a 5 wave structure off the 2015 lows , and a 5 wave structure off the 2016 lows , I am going to assume the more bullish counts as we set up for a potentially large 3rd- wave to take hold. - If the market tells me to adjust , I may miss some of the initial downside , but we have caught ourselves each and every time we have gotten a pullback without missing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treat the market in the same way going forward . <p> So , again , I am going to follow the more bullish expectations until the market suggests otherwise . - The first test we must now pass is completing a bigger 5 waves off of last week 's low , and we may not get the answer until early in the coming week . <p> WASHINGTON ( AP ) " President Donald Trump and some House conservatives agreed Friday to make changes in the troubled Republican health care bill in hopes of easing deep party divisions over the overhaul plan .

Today we look at some fundamental reasons why these stocks are lagging . Recent earnings are discussed as well as what will be needed to light a fire for the stocks . <p> I think its too soon to read much bearishness into the current action . The miners have already had a very nice move this year , even when priced in gold .

Heavy volume closing prints in $GDX and $GDXJ , totaling about US$1.8 billion in the final minute between the two ETFs . Some people speculating that the closing prints are a bullish indication because they occurred on an uptick , plus the heavy volume . Not necessarily bullish at all , market makers likely brought price down to those levels to get the trades done ( market makers knew how much was for sale 20 minutes+ before the close ) . <p> 4 . Only one explanation for todays type of selling , hedge fund liquidation en masse ( more than a couple of funds sold a lot of mining stock today ) . <p> 5 .

Chris Temple and I discuss what this does for the fence sitters and the potential of Trump getting anything done in Washington . <p> It looks to me we may be seeing a slow roll-over in the general markets . <p> The Democrats and a lot of RINOs hate the possibility of Trump taking away their crony punchbowl , so we are going to see little cooperation in Washington .

President Trump was partially elected because people could n't vote for someone who had no problem lying to the parents of deceased soldiers with their caskets present . The way that this was handled by the Trump Administration lacks integrity . President Trump has just planted seeds of doubt , much like a child that starts doubting that Santa Claus exists , he seldom believes in Santa again .

On the other hand the US only has 20 bilateral trade agreements covering less than 40% of its trading partners ; most notably missing is any tariff-free trade agreement with the EU .

The amount of money involved is over $3 Billion and probably close to $4 Billion . <p> Named after the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 , the FISC has been used to rubber-stamp warrants that grant the US intelligence community broad surveillance powers under amendments to that original law passed in 2008 . Court proceedings are secret ; the first time the public ever saw one of its decisions was when Edward Snowden revealed the existence of the PRISM program in 2013 by showing an NSA warrant to surveil the communications of Verizon customers . <p> Though we do n't  have a great understanding of what happens at the FISC , we do know that when the federal government asks for a warrant to spy on someone , that it always gets its wish .

In 2015 , it made 1,457 applications ; 80 were modified . <p> The anonymous sourcing of The Guardian article leaves several options , one of them much more plausible than the other considering what we know about FISC . It is highly unlikely that FISC " turned down " the FBIs application , because FISC has never turned down any warrant request that we know of . If it refused to grant a warrant in this specific instance , it would be completely unprecedented in known history of the court . More likely , then , is an October report that the FBI was forced to change its warrant application ( which is itself a rare occurrence ) before eventually getting it approved . <p> The FBIs interest in surveilling a presidential candidates political team is notable for obvious reasons , but its also worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Its chart looks bad , but it will likely provide a bounce in the near term . I like the fundamental drivers for KLDX Klondex in the mid term , and feel they have a lot going for them , but I may only be in for a swing trade for most of the position , and then just leave a small core position in place on the exit . <p> Longer term I completely agree that ( USAS ) Americas Silver should outperform on a percentage basis and it is one of my favorite Silver &amp; Zinc stocks . With the amount of Zinc &amp; Lead theyll be producing this year and the ramp up of San Rafael in the 3rd &amp; 4th Quarters , I truly believe Americas Silver is going to put on its dancing shoes in the second half of 2017 , but really 2018 should be a show-stopper year for it . <p> On April 20 , 2017 at 11:02 pm , Excelsiorsays : <p> Bonzo I just saw the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  own any USAS yet . It is against my beliefs to tell anyone else what to buy , as all investors have to come to those conclusions based on their own due diligence , risk tolerance , time horizon , jurisdiction preferences , market cap preferences , liquidity preferences , and macro views of Gold , Silver , Zinc , Lead , Copper . <p> Personally I see Americas Silver as one of the best turn around stories in the Silver mining space the last few years and I 've been following the story for years , since the Scorpio mining days , then into the merger with US Silver &amp; Gold , then the cost controls/new mining approach/new strategy that emerged as Americas Silver , and a successful track record of management executing on initiatives and guidance since then . <p> What I find interesting is their present strategy to ramp up the Zinc &amp; Lead production this year while those prices have been screaming higher , and save much of their high grade Silver for better prices ( they are still going to produce Silver but they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any upside in the Silver pricing ) . <p> That strategy resonates with what I want to see other Silver companies doing in this market set up , and make hay while the Zinc/Lead sun is shining , and keep back some of their better Silver resources for ensuing higher prices as the bull market starts to move higher over the next 12-18 months . <p> The real game changer for Americas Silver is when San Rafael comes online later this year , it will begin to drive their cost from $9-$10 down to $2-$3 and that particular mine will actually have negative costs due to the base metal credits . That is quite a set up for them moving into 2018 , so if the market starts connecting the dots later this year , I planning on being well positioned in front of that . It is already a nice sized Silver/Zinc mining position for me , but I 'll likely be adding to it on any weakness over the summer season . <p> For homework , I 'd start with digging into their last 2-3 years of press releases , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across a few different metrics , ascertain your view of Silver/Zinc/Lead prices , and it may paint the picture better by pulling up a longer term chart to see where its been in better cycles ( when it did n't  have near the portfolio of mines and development/exploration projects that it holds currently ) . <p> Another recent plus is that USAS just recently picked up another advanced development property off Santa Cruz Mining as they were trying to transfer this over to Hochschild and the deal was in a stalemate . Americas Silver swooped in and grabbed it up ( which really helped Santa Cruz clear a path forward as well ) and got Hochschild off the hook . Anyway , the point is that they have many catalysts over the next 2 years that will ultimately further transform the company . <p> Matthew and Excelsior , thanks for you thoughts about USAS .

Got in the highs of $2 and been accumulating slowly . Grade is not spectacular but cant ignore the fact it has so much gold in the ground and when all said and done if there ever will be a mine it will produce around 2000 ounces of gold daily for two decades . <p> Dear Al , I do not like snow or snakes . Which mine(s) should I send an application for employment to knowing the above ? Thanks ! Dennis <p> On October 5 , 2012 at 8:55 pm , Dennis F. Brophysays : <p> Hi Al , nice to see what people call alot of gold is today . Though its looks pretty low for me , in so many grams per ton figures . Different strokes for different folks is what 's its all about . Though during the CA gold rush having 1-3 oz per ton was super good back then though . My chemical extraction process is good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem lies . Ill be incorporating pretty soon , then I can get my metals to market with a good secondary refiner . Right now I 'm incorporating my contractors lic. # as a C corporation , then down the road as an S corporation with a partner , while still maintaining my original lic. # , inactive of course . Using my Lic. to jump start my mining/refining business . I do n't  want partners as a corporation ( closed corporation ) only to get around the Patriot Act for doing business as a mining company . The troubles one has to go through to make money . The ore concentrate is really valuable , its got a lot of Iron in it 76% which makes it good for the leach I use for processing it . As the Iron goes into solution the gold , silver , Pd , Pt , salts go into the solution as well . Thiourea which is an organic leach coupled with H2SO4 acid , the Ferric Iron(FeIII) which acts as an oxidizer works well with the Thiourea . Though at the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pH of 6-12 formamidine breaks down to cyanamide and elemental sulphur which has to happen to get the gold out of solution using stabilized form of sodium borohydride . In obtaining the precious metals using potassium permanganate coupled with H2SO4 causes the causes the salts in the liquid to go into solution , then I apply the SBH ( sodium borohydride ) resin the salts become metals instantly . Its wonderful obtaining precious metals chemically when you know how to do it . Its taken years to having done it . Its kind of what they say about Ron Paul that one word describes him being " consistent " . Having a process that has consistent framed into it , is what a success can be . Producing from this ore concentrate 2.33oz of gold per pound , .66oz of Pd per pound makes what others that have a 401K or a retirement pension fund have . Its sure a good time to have precious metals in the ground , when all hell is raging above the ground . <p> Please send me some material on what you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , <p> Big Al <p> On October 7 , 2012 at 3:17 am , Dennis F. Brophysays : <p> Hi Al , do you want some of my ore concentrate , it looks like black sand , but is color is purple . Its quite hard to fire assay . If you assay it , just typically you will get only 0.4oz. of gold per ton . At least what others that did the assay on it did to it . It acts like a telluride type ore , though it does n't  have tellurium in it . If you do a reduction assay using hydrogen the gold will be there . I had a guy from MineX look at it , he used a hydrogen furnace on it and produced gold , but was really shady , wanted the location of it , probably wanted to steal it from me . The chinese wanted 3 metic tons per week through MineX , checked him out on the internet , found him being sued by numerous people on the web , that was many years ago though . As you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I told you that Ive been working on this material since 1985 to break it chemically , so its a tough one to get a handle on it . I found it back it 1983 just walking around , then came on a camp fire with some boards partially consumed in the fire wood , it was cold when I came upon them . I flipped them over and found what looked like gold on the backs of them . I was really hooked later on while in the back yard experimenting on some wood and some of this material , then I quite by chance produced a gold bead on glance it was hard , but soft metal bead . I was in love . Yes hooked on this ore . In 1995 produced 10.25 grams of 80% precious metals from some 2 Lbs . of ore concentrate . Sold it to J.M. Ney just 8.25 grams of it and produced 3.141 oz. of gold , 1.775 oz. of Pd , .07 oz. of Pt , 1.148 oz. of silver , it was my 1st check . <p> On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brophysays : <p> ooops. that 's 10.25 ozs . of which was determined to be 80% high grade precious metal content , sent J.M. Ney 8.25 ozs . was paid . <p> I am asking because we get down there probably 1/2 dozen times per year and it would be fun to get together . <p> Big Al <p> On October 7 , 2012 at 9:09 pm , Dennis F. Brophysays : <p> I 'm just a nobody , a bit of an eccentric I guess , only have a few friends . Bill Earnshaw is a miner friend usually doing things like me , but has been hard rock mining for 35 years or so , since he was in his early twenties , we worked together in 2007 down at his place around the L.A. area , he s not there now mostly in AZ working on Silver &amp; Gold . He goes to Mexico , all over the western United States , he s really knows how to assay complex and otherwise difficult ores . Bill thinks my ore is valuable too , but not as much as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ozs . of gold per ton of the concentrate . He s only work on some that had some 200 ozs . of gold per ton before , but he s not into chemicals like me . Bill thinks my ore has Rh in it too , but Ag does some of the same things to itself as does Rh . In the " F " deposit , I had it assayed by another Assayer and he came up with only .494 oz. per ton on that ore , not my " MS " ore . He used a microwave technique , oh yes just remembered his name Greg Iceman , may have to look it up later and tell you the correct spelling if you want of his last name , well that sounds like it . I do n't  live in L.A .. I live near San Jose , CA . Some day I 'll have to return to my roots near Redding CA . Perhaps Old Shasta , near Redding where there 's hard rock gold to be found . I found a lode gold deposit up there in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for lode deposits never placer depositsMore rambling . <p> With ever decreasing grams per ton and ever increasing costs to mine ( 25% in fuel costs alone not to mention increasing labor and royalty expenses ) why does n't  existing physical make more sense with all of these costs already in the spot value ? What am I missing ? <p> On October 6 , 2012 at 12:15 pm , Dennis F. Brophysays : <p> Hi Dai Uy , because at $1781.30 per oz. of Gold @ 2.33 ozs . per Lb. of ore concentrate &amp; approx. $636 per oz. of Pd per Lb. of ore concentrate spells $8,300,860 per ton of this type of ore for gold ; approx. $839,520 per ton of this type of ore for Pd , plus the Pt 1/5 to 1/4 oz per Lb. &amp; Ag are quite alot in precious metals in my opinion for a ton of my ore . I 'm a one man operation , I 'll automate the entire process . Using electricity , H2SO4 acid NaOH , SBH are about the only things that 's are pricey . But upon going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> On October 5 , 2012 at 10:26 pm , Dai Uysays : <p> Not to mention 3rd party and difficult financing risks <p> On October 6 , 2012 at 12:23 pm , Dennis F. Brophysays : <p> Perhaps for you and others . If and when I buy into what you guys do , sure its going to be bad , if the people doing those low amounts precious metals per ton ratio is the factor , why yes its a problem .

The overwhelming fundamental factor that he watches are real interest rates and with the Fed continuing to raise rates and inflation rolling over this lead to some skepticism . <p> Over the past 10 years the Yen is up 5% , Gold 82% .

This is crystal clear from when they announced a giant QE in 2013 , which corresponded to a massive , sustained waterfall decline in $xjy . <p> BoJ needs to tighten or the Fed needs to loosen for commodities to get anything other than a technical bounce . <p> On May 10 , 2017 at 12:52 pm , Matthewsays : <p> The yen moves like gold because of the carry trade . Gold goes up when systemic risks rise because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ systemic risks rise because so much yen has been borrowed and sold to buy " risk-on " assets and needs to be repurchased . <p> Gold is up more than five-fold versus the yen this century and is currently in a big bullish consolidation .

The problem is $gold : $xjy direction tells you nothing about price . <p> Its little consolation that $gold : $xjy will go up if that is achieved by gold tanking a little less than yen .

And any new loosening/QE by the Fed will flow right to the stock market ( although commodities should rally too , and likely more ) . <p> Tad Agreed on your comment about disconnecting the longer term picture of Gold and Yen . Theyve been traveling in tandem for exactly the reasons the Matthew laid out up above Gold as a Safety play , and the Yen as a popular carry trade when investors need to rotate out of risk assets in times of fear ( so it benefits like a safety play for now ) . <p> However , as interesting as the correlation is at present and clearly there have been HFT algos keyed off this correlation for the last 2 years ; longer term they will decouple and Gold will outperform the Yen in a major way . <p> It is important to understand the last 2-3 years of correlation is mostly due to how the Yen is used as a carry trade , but that Gold is very much marching to the beat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2017 at 1:35 pm , spankysays : <p> Also , not going to lie : the monthly $gold : $xjy chart has been consolidating for 6 years now and is now in an incredibly tight range , historically speaking .

Brophysays : <p> Hi Al , nice to see what people call alot of gold is today . Though its looks pretty low for me , in so many grams per ton figures . Different strokes for different folks is what 's its all about . Though during the CA gold rush having 1-3 oz per ton was super good back then though . My chemical extraction process is good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem lies . Ill be incorporating pretty soon , then I can get my metals to market with a good secondary refiner . Right now I 'm incorporating my contractors lic. # as a C corporation , then down the road as an S corporation with a partner , while still maintaining my original lic. # , inactive of course . Using my Lic. to jump start my mining/refining business . I do n't  want partners as a corporation ( closed corporation ) only to get around the Patriot Act for doing business as a mining company . The troubles one has to go through to make money . The ore concentrate is really valuable , its got a lot of Iron in it 76% which makes it good for the leach I use for processing it . As the Iron goes into solution the gold , silver , Pd , Pt , salts go into the solution as well . Thiourea which is an organic leach coupled with H2SO4 acid , the Ferric Iron(FeIII) which acts as an oxidizer works well with the Thiourea . Though at the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pH of 6-12 formamidine breaks down to cyanamide and elemental sulphur which has to happen to get the gold out of solution using stabilized form of sodium borohydride . In obtaining the precious metals using potassium permanganate coupled with H2SO4 causes the causes the salts in the liquid to go into solution , then I apply the SBH ( sodium borohydride ) resin the salts become metals instantly . Its wonderful obtaining precious metals chemically when you know how to do it . Its taken years to having done it . Its kind of what they say about Ron Paul that one word describes him being " consistent " . Having a process that has consistent framed into it , is what a success can be . Producing from this ore concentrate 2.33oz of gold per pound , .66oz of Pd per pound makes what others that have a 401K or a retirement pension fund have .

If you assay it , just typically you will get only 0.4oz. of gold per ton . At least what others that did the assay on it did to it . It acts like a telluride type ore , though it does n't  have tellurium in it . If you do a reduction assay using hydrogen the gold will be there . I had a guy from MineX look at it , he used a hydrogen furnace on it and produced gold , but was really shady , wanted the location of it , probably wanted to steal it from me . The chinese wanted 3 metic tons per week through MineX , checked him out on the internet , found him being sued by numerous people on the web , that was many years ago though . As you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I told you that Ive been working on this material since 1985 to break it chemically , so its a tough one to get a handle on it . I found it back it 1983 just walking around , then came on a camp fire with some boards partially consumed in the fire wood , it was cold when I came upon them . I flipped them over and found what looked like gold on the backs of them . I was really hooked later on while in the back yard experimenting on some wood and some of this material , then I quite by chance produced a gold bead on glance it was hard , but soft metal bead . I was in love . Yes hooked on this ore . In 1995 produced 10.25 grams of 80% precious metals from some 2 Lbs . of ore concentrate . Sold it to J.M. Ney just 8.25 grams of it and produced 3.141 oz. of gold , 1.775 oz. of Pd , .07 oz. of Pt , 1.148 oz. of silver , it was my 1st check . <p> On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brophysays : <p> ooops. that 's 10.25 ozs . of which was determined to be 80% high grade precious metal content , sent J.M.

There should be an arbitrage situation coming up in October , because of the divergence of A ans H shares . Several companies trade as H and A share , but a share in the company is typically valued more highly on the mainland . As part of the introduction into the SDR regime , I would expect more convertibility to happen for China and eventually A and H shares to become one and the same .

There is a fair amount of focus on technical factors especially Elliot Wave theory but it is worth a quick read . <p> In a recent interview I conducted with the legendary market technician Robert Prechter , he offered some very interesting insights into how he views todays market , along with his perspective on socionomics . He also provides us with a general forecast as to how he sees the market playing out in the coming decade . <p> 1 . How did you come across Elliott wave analysis ? <p> My dad subscribed to Richard Russells- Dow Theory Letters , and he would occasionally forward his copies to me . In 1968 , Russell began writing about A.J. Frosts Elliott wave work . He published wave interpretations for the Dow off and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the bear market . During that time , I began charting gold and gold stocks , labeling the waves . After I became a professional technician at Merrill Lynch in 1975 , I went on a search for Elliotts original books , which were published in ring binders . The Library of Congress did n't  have them . Finally , I found copies on microfilm in the New York Public Library . It was a thrill coming across those listings on library cards . In 1980 , I republished Elliotts original books and articles in what is now called- R.N. Elliotts Masterworks . Later I published all of Boltons , Frosts and Russells Elliott wave writings along with bios and notes . In case you know any Elliott wave fanatics who want these books , my staff set up a discount page good through May- here . <p> 2a . This question is simply asking for your perspective on how markets have changed if at all over the decades in which you have been analyzing Elliott waves . <p> Markets have changed in superficial ways but not in any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But that does n't  mean it has been easy . Wave V from 1974 has been unusually large in both price and time relative to waves I and III . The closest thing to it in the record is the 1932-1937 rise , in which wave five lasted 15 times as long as wave one . Also , from 1987 to 2007 , pullbacks were shallow and skewed upward in the Dow and S&amp;P , which threw me off . <p> Some analysts credit the Feds inflating for these market attributes . But even as the Fed was expanding the money supply at a record rate , the 2007-2009 drop in the Dow was deeper than one would have expected for wave C of a Primary-degree flat . So , that causal argument is spurious . Here in 2017 , even the Dow/PPI is at an all-time high . I chalk it all up to Grand-Supercycle-degree optimism . That 's why we have record credit expansion , too , along with cooperation among members of the Federal Reserve Board and political support for the Fed . All that will change when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and proliferation of computer-executed trading , what effect do you feel they have had upon Elliott wave analysis , other than the speed at which trading is now effectuated ? <p> Virtually none . People build their errors of thinking into their programs . <p> 3a . We have analyzed thousands of charts on multiple timeframes and have found a few rules and/or guidelines that MAY be a bit too strict . For example , the rule that states " Waves 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 and 5 of an ending diagonal always subdivide into zigzags " seems to be a bit too stringent as a hard rule , as we believe we have found examples when an Ending Diagonal does not subdivide in this manner . So , are there any plans to update any of the rules within the standard EW structure now that we have decades of further real world example of chart patterns ? <p> An Elliott wave group in Russia asked if diagonals can occasionally have a third wave longer than wave one . The answer is pretty much the same : <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inferred Elliott waves of shared mood . But there are no categorical imperatives pertaining to records of the actions people take to express their moods . Market prices are imperfect reflections of market mood , because they record only peoples actions . Waves at small degrees-intraday-are especially imperfect because some individual trading actions can be either forced or impeded by circumstances . Until we can probe peoples brains to record waves of social mood directly , we are stuck with this imperfection . If you read the paragraph on page 86 of- Elliott Wave Principle- titled " A Summary of Rules and Guidelines for Waves , " you can see that I explicitly stated this point in the book . <p> Figure 1-18 in that book , which was published in 1978 , shows a long third wave in a contracting diagonal , and waves two and four do n't  even overlap . I decided as soon as it ended that a diagonal was the best count , since the subdivisions were three waves , the shape was a wedge , and it was the fifth wave of a decline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over . <p> Until we have a statistical answer to the question of when to allow this or that variation , the best answer is a practical one , and here is mine : The only time an analyst should allow an imperfection in a wave is- retrospectively- when all other aspects of the wave demand it . Suppose you see a wedge-shaped fifth wave with 4-1 overlap and three-wave subdivisions , but wave 3 is longer than wave 1 , or one of the waves subdivides into a five . If your next alternative is even less compatible with the model , then label the wave a diagonal . <p> One should never bet that a- developing- diagonal will break from the standard form . It will lead you to trouble 9 times out of 10 . But once the wave ends , a diagonal with a quirk may be better than any alternative . That is how to use rules . There is no purist solution for this issue ; there is only the best solution . <p> 3b . Along these lines , I have seen many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with any degree of success . If there were any aspect of Elliotts structure to be its weakest link , where would you see the potential for such modification to find success in the future ? <p> You 're right . I have seen two attempts by others to change Elliotts fundamental observations , and I have not adopted either of them , because I do n't  see them dominating prices . <p> I have suggested three variations on forms : the leading diagonal ( in which the odd-numbered waves can subdivide into five ) , the expanding diagonal and the skewed triangle . I remain skeptical about the legitimacy of all three of these forms . I suspect the patterns I described are more likely artifacts of imperfect mood recording than legitimate formations . <p> On the other hand , over the years I and my colleagues have made a number of valuable observations about wave forms that Elliott never noticed . Some have become well known , others not . They are : <p> ( 1 ) Wave three is most often the extended wave . <p> ( 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wave , i.e. in wave 3 of 3 of 3 . <p> ( 3 ) In the stock market , fifth waves are always weaker than third waves . <p> ( 4 ) B waves of contracting triangles often reach a new price extreme . <p> ( 5 ) Even so , E waves of triangles in the wave four position always end within the territory of the preceding third wave . <p> ( 6 ) Double flats are somewhere between rare and non-existent , Ive seen flat-X-triangle serve as double three . <p> ( 7 ) The barrier triangle is a more useful idea than the idea of independent ascending and descending triangles . <p> ( 8 ) Zigzags often adhere to channels . <p> ( 9 ) In zigzags , A waves tend to be steeper than C waves . <p> ( 10 ) In flats , C waves tend to be steeper than A waves . <p> Then there is the whole discussion of wave personalities that I put in- Elliott Wave Principle . <p> 4a . While we use various technical indicators to support or show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been the MACD . Do you have any favorites that have been most useful to you over the years ? <p> Nearly all momentum indicators provide the same basic information . There are hundreds of them , because they are easy to construct , especially with computers . I do n't  chart rates of change anymore because I can tell what they look like just by looking at prices . But momentum analysis is not simple . In the stock market , slowing momentum nearly always precedes reversals , but slowing momentum does not mean a reversal must follow . The 1985 and 1989-1994 periods are classic examples . In each case , the market slowed its rise-looking terminal from a momentum standpoint-and then accelerated . In the first case , I knew wave 3 of 3 was dead ahead , so I was really bullish . The second one threw me off . The most consistently useful momentum indicator is breadth . If I had to rely on only one momentum indicator , that would be it . <p> 4b . Do you have any specific time frames in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most insight into a specific market or commodity ? <p> No . Markets are fractals . Nothing quantitative is meaningful or useful . <p> 5a . As I am sure you are well aware , there is a debate amongst various schools of thought as to what is more important price or time . Can you please give us insight into your perspective on this debate ? <p> What matters most is form . Form involves both price and time , although arguably price is the more definitive component . <p> 5b . I am sure you have seen much time cycles analysis in your career . In my experience , I have not really seen any that have been better than 50/50 . I am just wondering why you think we are unable to develop the same accuracy percentages in timing models as we do in pricing models using Elliott Wave ? <p> I think the reason for your observation is that cycles are not the essence of markets . They are artifacts of the fractal form . They appear for a while and then disappear . Usually by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is poised to vanish . As you say , the success rate is about 50/50 , so I do n't  rely on them anymore . <p> I think Fibonacci ratios between the prices and durations of related waves are meaningful . I wrote a book about Fibonacci relationships called- Beautiful Pictures . <p> 6a . I have personally noted how I view socionomics as the ground-breaking work which will eventually lead market analysis into the future . But , I also understand how old habits are hard to break , and most still desperately cling to the old Newtonian-based exogenous-causation theories of market analysis . What sort of reception has the socionomic theory been receiving from the world of academia ? <p> It has had wisps of success . We have had several academic papers published , and another was accepted by a journal last week . A ranking member of the Academy of Behavioral Finance and Economics commented to me that the term socionomics was becoming part of the lexicon , which was encouraging to hear . Several professors at mid-level universities are including it in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to provide a good word for the book . But most economists do n't  know socionomics exists , and most of them would dismiss it if they did . Socionomic theory explains why such a reaction is , generally speaking , imperative : People are built better to participate in waves of social mood than to analyze them . So , its very hard to get the word out . People like you , who do pure market analysis , have been the quickest to get it . <p> 6b . As new studies into the socionomic aspects of financial markets are performed all the time , are there any other resources for us to follow to gain continuing insight into this perspective ? <p> Thanks for asking . The Socionomics Institute puts out tons of interesting material . The website is full of studies , articles , events and videos . People who like this field should become a member . Just go- here . <p> 6c . What are your top three arguments to present to those who do not believe in socionomics but still hold fast to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in- The Socionomic Theory of Finance- to present arguments . But I can make three brief statements : <p> ( 1 ) Events and conditions that are often labeled " fundamentals " have no predictability with respect to the behavior of financial markets , so they can not be causal . ( See Chapters 1 , 2 and 22 . ) <p> ( 2 ) Financial markets differ in numerous fundamental ways from economic markets , implying that their behaviors spring from different causes . The key difference is that in economic markets the context is one of relative certainty with respect to ones own personal values , which allows for rational decision-making , whereas in financial markets the context is one of pervasive uncertainty with respect to others future actions , which prompts people to herd . ( See Chapters 12 and 13 . ) <p> ( 3 ) Postulating unconscious waves of social mood as a hidden variable explains a persistently compatible relationship among myriad social actions , from popular musical tastes to changes in the economy to political actions to womens fashions to trends in the stock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> 7a . I know that once this market tops , you expect a major bear market and economic contraction to take hold . What is your modified general timing for this to occur ? <p> The true top for stocks in terms of real money ( NASDAQ:GOLD ) occurred way back in 1999 . Overall prosperity has waned subtly since then . Primary wave five in nominal terms started in March 2009 , and wave B up in the Dow/gold ratio started in 2011 . Their tops should be nearly coincident . <p> 7b . What do you foresee will set off this event ? <p> Triggers are a popular notion , borrowed from the physical sciences . But I do n't  think there are any such things in financial markets . Waves of social mood create trends in the stock market , and economic and political events lag them . Because people do not perceive their moods , tops and bottoms in markets sneak right past them . At the top , people will love the market , and events and conditions will provide them with ample bases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long do you expect we will be mired in a " depression-type " event ? <p> I do n't  know . All I can say for sure is that the degree of the corrective wave will be larger than that which created the malaise of the 1930s and 1940s . <p> 7d . Where do you suggest people " hide " during this event for financial safety and why ? <p> Short-term notes of the least unstable governments , held in the safest manner possible . The plan is to trade these things for stocks , property and precious metals near the bottom . <p> 8 . Are you involved in any other projects ? <p> I 've got two compendiums due out in book form in late spring : - Socionomic Studies of Society and Culture-which will have our best work relating socionomic causality to trends in movies , music , TV , cars , skyscrapers , roller coasters and other fun stuff-and- Socionomic Causality in Politics , which may not be as fun , but its important . <p> Another project we have going is computerizing Elliott wave analysis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were doing , and were getting it right . <p> On the business side , I have cut back . I 'm down to about two speeches a year and pretty much retired from doing media . I 'm still involved in macro business matters , but I have a great team handling the rest . I do the occasional Q&amp;A , so allow me to say thanks for the opportunity . <p> I want to thank Bob Prechter for allowing me the honor of conducting this interview . I also want to congratulate him on his new book , The Socionomic Theory of Finance , which I believe it is a " must read " for anyone who wants to truly have their eyes opened as to how the market really works . <p> Bob does a masterful job in the first two chapters of completely debunking the entire exogenous causation theory of market analysis . These first two chapters alone are worth the cost of the book , in my humble opinion . <p> I look forward to the day when analysts realize the folly in the Newtonian-based analysis primarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groundbreaking masterpiece which will take market analysis into the future . Again , this is a must read for anyone that is serious about understanding how our non-linear financial markets really works . <p> I personally owe a tremendous debt of gratitude to Bob Prechter for opening my mind and my eyes as to the true realities of market dynamics . 216618 @qwx1076618 <p> Associated Press 21 minutes ago WASHINGTON ( AP ) " The Trump administration has denied a request from Exxon Mobil to waive U.S. sanctions against Russia and allow it to resume oil drilling around the Black Sea . <p> Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin says in a brief statement that the administration " will not be issuing waivers to U.S. companies , including Exxon , authorizing drilling prohibited by current Russian sanctions .

" <p> Purepoint is Nexgens neighbor and part of the same trend so it makes sense they are finding good grade . <p> Cameco is a mess , and TEPCO denying delivery ( because their contract price was at $107 when spot is only $25 ) is the real issue , but they are getting out of the contract due to the Force Majeure clause . <p> Energy Fuels continues to impress , and they keep finding more and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Copper find is interesting , and is just a further kicker credit on that project . <p> Fun times ! <p> On February 2 , 2017 at 9:02 am , Bob UKsays : <p> Cameco having a direct affect on URA due to it being such a large component of the uranium etf .

@@120399895 @9399895/ 216618 @qwx1076618 <p> Gold stays cheap until the paper markets lose pricing power . That occurs when the only supply out there is the actual mined supply . When people have run out of scrap , and the weak hands like El Salvador , Venezuela , Ukraine , Greece have all sold out , then the paper markets end . <p> I am following many of the names he mentioned as well like Detour Gold , Endeavour Silver , Lake Shore Gold , Klondex , and Tahoe Resources . I was not familiar with Dragon Gold or Norton Gold Fields in Australia . <p> For an Australian miner that was waayy oversold I like Metal X Ltd ( MLXEF ) . This company acquired a number of base metal ( largest tin producer in Australia ) , gold , silver , copper projects and merged 2 other smaller companies under its umbrella .

What you mention is a big fault in most of the newsletters I recall . They are never short of accolades for companies they like but somehow always fall down when it comes time to cut loose the losers ( and admit they are losers in the process ) . <p> It may be something to do with human nature though . <p> Have you ever noticed how few people have any luck on the short side ? Its really a pretty specialized part of the investment world and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people prefer to run with the herd and do plain momentum trades in one direction ( up ) while avoiding the risks of the periodic and much less popular declines . <p> Odds favour bullishness but for the guys who master short selling , the profits can be much more rewarding . <p> On May 1 , 2015 at 12:51 pm , original jjsays : <p> We are programed Bulls its human nature . If one trades off the chart indicators holding a short position is as natural as a long position , although I 've made far more trading off a long position over the years as short positions are usually very quick and much shorter in duration . Often a great position is 100% cash and imo that 's where at a min the goldbug gurus let their sheeple down big time once $1525 broke as they should have been told to get to the life boats taking great gains in the run from 2000-11instead ever big decline was just another buying opp.ouch ! <p> Regardless , trade it long to cash at a min if one cant manage a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sell side advice ( I have no idea , maybe Al does ) why is he any different than any other buy side only salesmen ? nobody in their right mind would suggest the pms sector is in a clear bull market , if they do run from that opinion ! <p> On May 1 , 2015 at 1:28 pm , Birdmansays : <p> Yes , they did let their subscribers down . Amazing so few of those newsletter writers seemed to appreciate the gravity of the declines that were clearly in motion . Especially in light of silvers crystal clear parabolic rise and crash . <p> I recall those dark days very well . <p> It was like there were a thousand voices shouting " its going up again " ! ! ! and " back up the truck " ! ! ! And there I was . One lonely voice squaring off against a fanatical angry mob who cursed me to hell for putting up charts proving that we were entering a bear market . <p> Rough days .

I was also paying a subscription for their " service " <p> On May 1 , 2015 at 3:36 pm , Birdmansays : <p> Just to give Michael credit though , he seems like a pretty bright guy to me and after listening to him in past shows he definitely understands when to get out of a trade that 's heading South . <p> Hopefully he reads these comments though just so he knows one of the biggest complaints subscription buyers had in the past with the way gold and gold stocks were being promoted . <p> On May 1 , 2015 at 5:12 pm , Shadsays : <p> I think Michael seem quite tuned into when it is time to sell , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the traditional markets and into commodities , and he has waited until now to start balancing the reallocating funds over to the hard assets now the conventional markets have had their fun . <p> It is really about following the flows into and out of sectors that he seems to understand , so that works . His stock list tells me he has picked a few winners already . <p> On May 1 , 2015 at 5:27 pm , Shadsays : <p> I do agree that you can often make more shorting a stock , index , or ETF in a compressed time frame , but the duration is much quicker . The increase in equities is usually the gradual stair step up and the blow-off top , the quick crash down . It is silly that most do n't  play both directions . <p> On May 1 , 2015 at 5:47 pm , Birdmansays : <p> Yeah , and it was pretty decent of him to let us know what his first group of stock picks were . So I made a note of them for the record @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Guyana , Lakeshore , Endeavor and Klondex . Not a bad list actually . Shows he has a good handle on what 's moving . <p> On May 1 , 2015 at 6:37 pm , Shadsays : <p> Yeah that 's my point . He s on it with the stock picks as I was watching all those companies except the 2 Australian ones ( Dragon and Norton Gold Fields ) as those were new to me . Tahoe Resources , Detour Gold , Klondex , Endeavour Silver , Guyana Goldfields , and Lake Shore Gold were already on my watch-lists and/or want-lists . <p> Think about it this way : * J.Paulson ( shorting sub-prime ) * G.Soros ( on his famous short GBP bet in the early 90s ) * M. Hart ( long Greece CDS in the late 2000s ie betting against Greece debt ) * K. Bass ( short sub-prime , short Iceland late 2000s I think and more recently short JPY ) * J. Chanos ( " Mr. Short " ) . <p> Personally , the most successful traders I know those that make 7 $ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shorting and make probably 90% of their profits shorting . <p> Probably almost every super-super-super successful investors are contrarians . They are successful because they bet against the crowd for they make outsized returns when they are proven right . Now there are 2 ways to bet against the crowd : 1 ) buy hated value at cheap prices ( W. Buffett ) -&gt; buy when they are no sellers left 2 ) short something that has gone up too much in valuation/price and is about to witness a change in momentum . -&gt; short when there are no buyers left <p> Typically , at turning points , the 2 ) is QUICKLY rewarding , while the 1 ) typically takes more time to bring " good " returns . The reason is that in the 2 ) when everyone is loaded , and things turn , then everyone wants to get out at the same time so the stock takes the elevator down . In the 1 ) , it takes time for a bull market to form ( denial phase , first stage of the bull , growing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stocks take the steps to go into bull market mode . <p> Best to you , <p> LPG <p> On May 1 , 2015 at 8:02 pm , Shadsays : <p> I totally agree with the buying low and selling high contrarian bets LPG , and most of the successful traders I have known excelled at both , but usually made their fortunes on the short side . The saying that equities take the stairs up and the elevator down is an old truism , yet so many are surprised when it happens over and over again . <p> On May 1 , 2015 at 12:02 pm , FranSixsays : <p> One thing to remember about gold miners is that a serious portion of their public floats , sometimes all of the publicly held shares have to be settled at the nearest opportunity should the gold price resume its bull market .

In other words , its a " private joke " . Apologies for the confusion caused . = <p> I just googled " Harmun Kordin " for the sake of it and I smiled when I saw the search results . <p> Best to you Shad and sorry again for the confusion caused . <p> All have a good week-end . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Shadsays : <p> Funny . Thanks for clearing that up LPG . I had googled it as well : ) <p> The contrarian trade is short metals now . Everyone thinks metals and miners are going up , mostly because of the miners leading and up today . Also with gold stopping its down trend . <p> The whipsaw action has most programmed that gold is going up Monday . I 'm not in that camp . <p> On May 1 , 2015 at 1:09 pm , Birdmansays : <p> And the other contrarian trade is long oil . There is way too much press around the idea oil will fall below 44 bucks on its way to 30 or 20 dollars . But it ai n't  gon na happen the way I see it . This is a trade I want to be in . I feel that the lows are in and prices will just keep moving up towards the 70 mark before most cotton on that the bottom is done and finished . <p> It is all about the dollar . If you believe as I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from here then you must also agree that crude will rise inversely to USD ( the opposite of what happened when oil fell as the dollar rose ) . <p> Most of the market is going to miss the boat . Actually , a pretty juicy percentage of the gains are already behind us . As usual , Joe Public will catch on when the trade is already stale and near its end . <p> On May 1 , 2015 at 2:29 pm , Paul Lsays : <p> I made some very large gains the past many weeks with oil while everyone was negative on oil . I took profits a few days ago when they started singing about oil on the media and waited for a correction and loaded up again . There is going to be panic short covering when it goes above 60 likely on Monday . Long from $43 . I cant see a big fall coming like all the experts claim once it is above 60 . <p> On May 1 , 2015 at 3:44 pm , Birdmansays : <p> After my own heart Paul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think you are going to be right . There is a good possibility oil moves up sharply after that provided the dollar keeps weakening . <p> Right now we are in a dollar bounce though . That 's enough to keep the shorts short for awhile longer . I mean , if they doubt the dollar decline is real they wont bail on a losing positionthinking instead that price is going to swing back in their favour . <p> Its just the kind of setup that keeps everyone off balance and unsure of what is coming next . <p> On May 1 , 2015 at 1:07 pm , Jasonsays : <p> I agree with Gare , sort of . I disagree with the guy that needs to buy a comb , sort of . I will be playing the short side of gold for the ride down . <p> On May 1 , 2015 at 1:12 pm , Birdmansays : <p> Michael has the best hair ever . I do n't  have the guts to wear mine like that.but I am tempted ! <p> On May 1 , 2015 at 1:21 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes down , I see oil going up . But it looks like dollar up and oil down , along with metals down to me . But hey , you 're on a roll so ? The metals market ( slow drip / Chinese water torture ) has got to break soon .

@@120399907 @9399907/ <p> I would like to update you on the US dollar as it plays such an important role in so many different markets . Getting the big trend right on the US dollar can help you see what areas are affected by the dollar to invest in . There are a lot of areas that have an inverse correlation to the dollar , such as commodities and the precious metals in particular . <p> Let start with just with just a simple daily line chart that shows the two year sideways trading range with the breakout and the backtest that is currently underway . As you can see this is actually the 2nd backtest to the top rail at the 100 area so there is no question the top rail is hot . <p> This next chart for the US dollar is a daily bar chart which I 've been showing as a rectangle consolidation pattern . If one were to connect the reversal point , #1 and #3 for the top rail , and reversal points #2 and #4 for the bottom rail , we would have an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slightly down just a tad which would help in showing the backtest a little more clearly . The difference between the two would only be about a point or so . A good habit to get into when you see there may be a little morphing of a trendline is to tweak it , because it may be tested again at a later date . <p> Below is the updated version of the morphing rectangle halfway pattern which shows the nearly 2 year expanding falling wedge . The top rail is almost perfectly horizontal , but to get the backtest price objective right , every fraction of a point helps . <p> Tonight is the first time I 've shown this chart to you . Below is a weekly look at the US dollar which shows the blue expanding falling wedge and how it fits into the big picture as a halfway pattern to the upside . I 've shown you many bull markets that form one consolidation pattern on top of the next , which can go on for years . When a bull market ends there is usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signal a trend change . As long as the top rail of the blue expanding falling wedge holds support we have a consolidation pattern in place . Until the price action takes out the top rail to the downside we have a consolidation pattern , not a reversal pattern . <p> Note the H&amp;S consolidation pattern that formed on the right side of the blue consolidation pattern which should give the US dollar the energy it needs to have a successful breakout and impulse move to the upside . After the neckline breakout and the initial breakout above the top rail of the blue expanding falling wedge , the price action backtested the neckline with a nice long daily reversal bar . This week the US dollar is backtesting the top rail of the blue expanding falling wedge . The symmetry of the bigger H&amp;S shows the neckline symmetry line which is parallel to the neckline that showed us the low for the right shoulder . <p> If the US dollar is in a bull market on an intermediate term bases it should make higher highs and higher lows which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rail of the major uptrend channel has which tells us it 's an important trendline . You can do the same thing with the top rail which shows about 4 touches . Also , as you can see the major uptrend channel is not parallel , but more of a rising wedge formation with still a lot of overhead room for the US dollar to move higher . <p> That brings me up to the measured move for the blue expanding falling wedge halfway pattern . The first price objection is measured from the last reversal point in the blue triangle pattern at the bottom of the chart to the first reversal point in the blue expanding falling wedge . That distance is taken and added to the 4th reversal point in the blue expanding falling wedge to get a price objective up to the 113 area , as shown by the blue arrows , and is called an impulse measured move . <p> The second measured move is taken from the breakout point from the blue triangle to the first reversal point on the blue expanding falling wedge . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point of the blue expanding falling wedge which gives us a second price objective up to the 117.30 area . This is called the breakout to breakout measured move . This is on a linear scale chart . <p> This next chart is a log scale weekly look at the US dollar which gives us a little higher price objectives based on the two measured move techniques . If one was to look at the price action since the 2011 low and you did n't know what stock you were looking at you would most likely think that this stock is in a beautiful uptrend . <p> This next chart is a 35 year monthly look which shows the two big fractal bases labeled big base #1 , and big base #2 . Back in the late 1990 's when the US dollar broke out of big base #1 it formed the blue bullish rising wedge as a halfway pattern . That backtest to the top rail took three full months to complete before the second impulse move took off . If our current blue halfway pattern plays out it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is about as high as the 2000 bull market high . At that point we can look for another consolidation pattern to start building out if the US dollar is in a strong secular bull market . If this rally is like the last major impulse move up out of big base #1 then we should see some type of reversal pattern build out similar to what we saw at the 2000 high . That H&amp;S top in 2000 built the foundation for gold 's bull market to follow , which lasted close to 11 years . <p> Again , if the US dollar is in a secular bull market then it will most likely have a negative impact on commodities and the precious metals complex . For those members that were with us during the strong impulse move up out of big base #2 you will remember what that did to commodities , the precious metals complex and most of the important currencies of the world . With that said I 'm paying especially close attention to the commodities indexes for any sign of failure . The chart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example of to watch for . The price action will let us know of its intentions if we can keep an open mind . It is what it is until it is n't .

However , I believe it is one of many scenarios that could happen . Sub 1300 gold is a good place for new comers to buy gold coins in my opinion . I have said this for quite a while . No one takes me seriously because I am not an analyst but I feel strongly that if you do not have any gold this is a good time to find low premium coins such as kruggerands . You know , the older models . Get em cheap with low premiums . Buy what you can afford . A little at a time . Just in case the price goes lower as Gary says . What Gary is saying is not bullshit . It is just not backed by anything but educated guesses and is a possible scenario . In the Army we had risk assesments . Do a chart and study what the risk is . Sub 1300 dollar gold in the next 3 to 5 years is going to be a winner . Even my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5 years .

Someone considered Nadler a spoke person for bullion banks to talk down gold but I do n't  think so . I would say such a person is Jeff Christian . Nadler is too narrowly focused and not be able to consider new factors coming into the gold sector such as emergence of China and dwindling divestment from old investors and central banks . He seems only focus on jewelry industry in North America and India . Since gold is a political metal so in a more unstable financial time , many new factors will dwarf the old ones . <p> On October 7 , 2014 at 8:27 am , bbsays : <p> Funny , when he was on there he was always saying gold going to come down .

Before I can put much confidence in even a short term bottom , I need to see gold close above 1224 . <p> Interesting interview . To me , gold is stepping up within its downtrend , still means that it is basically trading sideways to down in the last 18 months . We had some recovery and then that had a breakdown in August 2014 as we broke the May 2014 low around $1240. now we are at $1200 or so and have bounced this week , I see short term resistance here now at $1241 then $1270 nd gold needs to go over $1270 to avoid just hitting resistance wihint the downtrend that was hit at just oevr $1300 in June and July . So gold is very slowly rolling to the upside but within a downtrend that has been in place since September 2012 . Arguably we have already broken out of the downtrend that defined the moves from $1800 down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the top of that channel . The recent low in the 1180s last week was clse to the top of that channel . We could still come down to test this channel at even lower levels later because it is a falling channel . If we fall back into the major downtrend channel , it has its bottom well under $800 , at $770 . The lows defing the channel were the $1520 lolw in May 2012 and the june 2013 low at $1180 . There are various other ones you could draw but all are downtrends that is the bottom line . There has not been a definitive breakout of any of them I would say , not yet .

Bron has been on the show a number of times and watch for him to be joining us on the weekedn show shortly . This article- originally appeared in the Gold Standard Institutes November journal here . <p> Nick Laird at Sharelynx has recently complied historical data from multiple sources on the amount of earmarked ( custodial ) gold held by the US Federal Reserve Bank for other central banks .

After this , the amount of gold in circulation as a proportion of total monetary gold reduced with the introduction of the Federal Reserve System . It ceased completely at the point holding gold was made illegal . <p> During the Bretton Woods period you will note that from 1950 to 1965 the total amount of gold held by the Fed was relatively stable at 25,000 tonnes . <p> However , the US ' gold reserves declined during this period from 22,000 tonnes to below 13,000 tonnes , with the ownership of the 9,000 or so tonnes simply being transferred to other central banks by book entry . In 1950 only 15% of the gold stored in the Fed was owned by foreign central banks " by the end of 1965 , 48% of the gold was owned by foreigners . This reflected the change in the US towards deficits and the exchange of dollars for gold by nations running trade surpluses with the US . <p> From 1965 onwards the US ' gold reserves continue to fall while the holdings of other central banks at- the Fed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not coincidental that foreign gold holdings at the Fed should peak at 12,282 tonnes in August 1971 , the month the US unilaterally cancelled the direct convertibility of the US dollar to gold .

Interesting as well that the gold price bottomed ( or dollar topped ) in April 2001 just ahead of the stabilisation of foreign gold holdings at the Fed in June 2001 and a peaking of the global mine hedge book in September 2001 ? <p> Focusing in more detail , the chart below of foreign central bank gold holdings at the Fed over the past fifteen years shows little activity except for 2007 and 2008 , when just under 410 tonnes was withdrawn " big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and France ( 227 tonnes ) .

Since June 2013 , 75 tonnes has been withdrawn and if all are related to Germany , then they are on track with their plans to transfer 150 tonnes from New York to Frankfurt by 2015 and another 150 tonnes by 2020.

Additional drilling and further metallurgical testing is planned toward the end of 2017 , and we are confident the recovery process will continue to improve as we advance Douay . " <p> A Bond Ball Mill Work Index ( the " Work Index " ) determination was performed on a combined composite sample of all the zones and the indicated mineralization is considered relatively hard . The Work Index value was determined to be 18.5 kWh/tonne . In addition to gravity concentration and flotation tests initial testing also examined whole feed cyanidation as a possible process to extract gold . The tests were all conducted at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6 , 24 and 48 hour leach times . Most of the samples displayed relatively fast cyanide leach times reaching a plateau at about 6 hours . The whole feed cyanide leaching response was highly variable : four sample composites achieved greater than 90% extraction . However , the average performance extraction was 81% , with two samples from the Northwest Zone having only 52% extraction . Cyanide and lime consumption was low , averaging 0.3 kg/t and 1.4 kg/t , respectively . <p> The gravity-flotation-leach process ( " GFL " ) should result in capital and operating cost advantages over whole ore leach . Flotation process equipment would be required , but the subsequent leach circuit would be approximately one-tenth the size of the whole ore leach process . The cyanide and lime consumption of the GFL process is estimated at only 0.2 kg/t and 0.4 kg/t of the feed . The initial testing produced positive metallurgical response , with further metallurgical testing warranted to optimize metallurgical response and lower the cost of the process . <p> Douay Gold Project and Company Profile <p> Aurvista Gold Corporation is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Project in Quebec .

Individually that is possible , but as a group , it is very unlikely . <p> GDX is well diversified but dominated by the biggest names .

Your rational ? <p> On April 7 , 2015 at 1:17 pm , Matthew ( ignoring Birdman ) says : <p> What Jason is doing is legit . If ( when ) the market goes against his long position , his short position will grow and give him the ability to buy more into the dip . A cash reserve obviously cant do that . Its psychologically beneficial too , since it allows a move against your core position to be seen in a positive way . <p> Just my 2 cents . Jason can probably add a few things . <p> On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I 've done it before as well , and it depends where in the move you purchase both of the ETFs , so that one of the moves acts like insurance .

What state will the rest of the world be in if gold and silver reach new highs ? And so forth it goes . <p> Realistically , gold is some $300 off clearing immediate resistance levels and silver nearly $10 . That is alot work to the upside that just wont happen in this current climate Especially considering the US $ dollar breakdown . Granted , the inverse relationship between the two is not always set in stone . But when the $ breaks two main levels of resistance ( without being an expert , the 100 mark and 97 handle were mentioned by some as significant support levels that I agreed with ) to the downside and the metals behave this way , one has to think that the bears continue to hold sway in the PMs . <p> I do n't  know when this bear will die in the PMs but it certainly has n't  yet . At these levels , gold and silver are veering towards that zone of undoing all their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the waiting game is a bore at times , but it appears the most prudent move ( or non-move if you like ) at this time for those who consider themselves investors more than traders . <p> I think that was bad data . The ratio hit 84-1 in March of last year and its now a little over 76-1 . According to Bob Hoye if it goes over 78-1 the financial system is highly stressed . I 'd be a buyer in here . Silver is cheap and gold expensive . Platinum/gold has touched negative $340 three times since early May and bounced off . <p> this is a pefect example in slot silver as a client leaves a large order if siovef trades below $15.67 ( I will leave you idiots to figure out its significance ) sell $400 mill of silver so the desk with the order triggers at the open a trade below $15.67 allowing the stop loss to kick while the trading desk sits on the much lower bids scooping up far more paper silver than they could by paying the offers.went on all the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mr bob or troll matt yoh two ever come close to REAL TRADING.you two would n't rate to write my tickets.yah and I 'm the idiot.OMGtell me another very old war story bob cause it so applies here <p> On July 6 , 2017 at 5:54 pm , Robert Moriartysays : <p> TB : <p> So you are working for someone else doing exactly the same thing as hundreds or thousands of other guys .

The idea that CNN would even think about investigating a person who jimmyrigged a CNN logo onto a WWF wrestling GIF is outrageous , indicative of an organization imploding from lack of leadership from within . <p> Who really cares about the juvenile GIF ?

You 're the simpleton for not knowing that . <p> On July 6 , 2017 at 7:21 pm , Excelsiorsays : <p> Agreed Matthew . The whole point is to know when to start positioning , and any investor that has done so when the BPGDM had an RSI below 10 has done very well catching the bounces . Pretty simple . <p> When the 50 day EMA and 200 day EMA cross , they confirm the trend . Maybe you need to learn the new skills pal . <p> Also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so do n't  act like that is the goose that laid the golden egg . Ira Epstein uses the 18 day .

That 's the first time renewable sources have outpaced nuclear since 1984 . <p> The growth in renewables was fueled by scores of new wind turbines and solar farms , as well as recent increases in hydroelectric power as a result of heavy snow and rain in Western states last winter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decades , and March and April are typically low-production months for nuclear plants .

I havnt kept in constant touch with the markets or the views on this site recently as I 'm travelling Australia . Occasionally glancing over the relative news concerning this issue over the last few weeks has allowed me to take stock and reassess . The PMs stink and show no signs of abating this sentiment . If anything its getting worse . <p> I know certain factors ( summer doldrums , interest rate rises , continued strength in other sectors ) contribute to the current slumber in PMs but what about the US $ breakdown , geopolitical tensions and the never ending spluttering of the world economy ? <p> Whether its manipulated or not ( and I think it is for what its worth ) , gold , silver and the rest are capped so strongly , I do n't  know what its going to take to break the resistance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raises more questions than answers : What time frame are we dealing with here ? What state will the rest of the world be in if gold and silver reach new highs ? And so forth it goes . <p> Realistically , gold is some $300 off clearing immediate resistance levels and silver nearly $10 . That is alot work to the upside that just wont happen in this current climate Especially considering the US $ dollar breakdown . Granted , the inverse relationship between the two is not always set in stone . But when the $ breaks two main levels of resistance ( without being an expert , the 100 mark and 97 handle were mentioned by some as significant support levels that I agreed with ) to the downside and the metals behave this way , one has to think that the bears continue to hold sway in the PMs . <p> I do n't  know when this bear will die in the PMs but it certainly has n't  yet . At these levels , gold and silver are veering towards that zone of undoing all their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the waiting game is a bore at times , but it appears the most prudent move ( or non-move if you like ) at this time for those who consider themselves investors more than traders . <p> I think that was bad data . The ratio hit 84-1 in March of last year and its now a little over 76-1 . According to Bob Hoye if it goes over 78-1 the financial system is highly stressed . I 'd be a buyer in here . Silver is cheap and gold expensive . Platinum/gold has touched negative $340 three times since early May and bounced off . <p> this is a pefect example in slot silver as a client leaves a large order if siovef trades below $15.67 ( I will leave you idiots to figure out its significance ) sell $400 mill of silver so the desk with the order triggers at the open a trade below $15.67 allowing the stop loss to kick while the trading desk sits on the much lower bids scooping up far more paper silver than they could by paying the offers.went on all the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mr bob or troll matt yoh two ever come close to REAL TRADING.you two would n't rate to write my tickets.yah and I 'm the idiot.OMGtell me another very old war story bob cause it so applies here <p> On July 6 , 2017 at 5:54 pm , Robert Moriartysays : <p> TB : <p> So you are working for someone else doing exactly the same thing as hundreds or thousands of other guys .

Then with the media invading us 24/7 with endless tragedies and grief , and we naturally transpose these into : Such misfortune could easily befall me or my loved ones . The Rolling Stone writer makes an important distinction between anxiety and fear . Anxiety otherwise known as worry comes from an Anglo-Saxon word to choke . The Bible tells us not to be choked by the cares of this world . Nor presumably are we even to be choked by the wars and rumours of wars that beset every generation , even when those wars destructive potential grows more massive year on year . .

The libertarian firebrands remarks encapsulate some of the unspoken qualms many hold about the state of the American economy and her equity markets . <p> In an interview with CNBCs " Futures Now , " last week , Paul reiterated his deep skepticism about the Fed and its loose money policies . <p> " After 35 years of a gigantic boom market in bonds believe me they can not reverse history and they can not print money forever , " Paul said . <p> The central bank has limits in what it can do to support growth , Paul said " meaning disaster may lie just around the corner . <p> " Its the fallacy of economic planning through monetary policy that 's at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monetary policy decisions have " nothing to do with freedom and free markets and capitalism and sound money . Its all artificial , its all political and that 's why were so vulnerable . " <h> Whos right and who 's wrong ? <p> For some , its the concept of " artifice " that 's particularly telling . Pauls political philosophy naturally leads him to oppose any flavor of government intervention , given his basic premise that more government is almost never good . <p> If the Feds actions have done anything to improve the state of the economy , then , the economy must be on shaky , " artificial " ground " and primed for a recession and stock market crash in the near future . <p> So why has n't  that happened yet " even after years of gloomy predictions ? <p> " I think the Fed is very efficient and the Plunge Protection Team is very efficient and they have gained a competence in the market , that the Fed wont allow this market to drop , " Paul said . He referred to the conspiracy theory that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capital markets by entering long equity positions . <p> Paul warned in his 2008 book " Revolution : A Manifesto " that when the Fed takes stimulative action , " it creates all kinds of economic problems . It decreases the value of the dollar , thereby making people poorer , " he wrote . <p> " When the money supply is increased , prices risewith each dollar worth less than before , it can purchase fewer good than it could in the past , " he added . " The average person is silently robbed through this invisible means . " <p> Yet after three rounds of quantitative easing , in which the Fed directly created money to buy bonds in the open market , inflation has remained quiescent , with deflation often posing the more realistic threat . <p> That leaves Paul waiting for the fulfillment of the other half of his 2008 prediction ; namely that " in the long run , even the apparent stimulus to the economy that comes from all the additional borrowing and spending turns out to be harmful has well , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and recession down the road . " <p> Pauls not the only one . Skepticism about the stock markets " artifice " runs deep , and may partially explain why the rally over the past six years has been one of the most maligned in history . <p> Concerns about the Fed have " created the single biggest opportunity over the past six years , " said investor and financial writer Mark Dow in an interview . " Everyone , at every turn , has overstated the damage that would be done by the Fed . Everyone said stimulus would n't work , " he said . <p> " And if you had bet on the Fed not causing inflation , if you had bet on the Fed being right about there not being a big spike in interest rates , if you had bet on there not being a Lehman Two , if you had bet that low rates were not going to produce a bubblethat was the trade , and that is the trade still , " Dow added . <p> As one particularly salient example , market strategist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two-year bear market for gold is over , and the uptrend is going to resume . " He added that " gold is your defense against the policies of the Fed . " <p> Gold was trading at about $1,370 when Boockvar made those remarks ; the metal is currently near $1,200 . In other words , gold may indeed have served as a defense against the prospect of the Fed causing massive inflation . <p> Yet with inflation still nowhere to be seen , and the Fed apparently preparing to raise rates , its proven an expensive insurance policy . ( Although , as Paul pointed out on Thursday , gold has served as a far better store of value than the U.S. dollar over the past hundred years . ) <p> Of course , predicting the future for stocks or the economy is what some might call a fools errand . But one thing remains clear : Those who have followed Paul and enshrined his philosophy into their investment decisions have , at best , missed out a gigantic rally in stocks . <p> Actually , they may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed the libertarian party line on gold and on bonds . <p> For instance , CNBC once spoke to a skeptical investor , who lamented his decision to short stocks and buy gold in 2013 " a year in which the S&amp;P 500 Index rallied nearly 30 percent , while gold did the opposite . <p> The Fed has not committed any obvious policy errors thus far . But critics of the central banks " artifice " , who deal in the staid worlds of economics and philosophy rather than the flesh-and-blood realm asset allocation , appear to have made a huge one . <p> Clarification : An earlier version misidentified the year in which the skeptical investor spoke about missing out on the rally . <p> " By CNBCs Alex Rosenberg. 216618 @qwx1076618 <p> The U.S. military is sharing a base in Iraq with Iranian Shiite military .

That 's like saying that because you can hear your car , its muffler is doing nothing .

Yes , that whole belt is heating up and the key is that Tecks future plans , along with Korea Zinc , make it an emerging area play to follow . Canada Zinc Metals is smack in the middle of it , and it seemed interesting that so few are paying attention to it . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound supply/demand fundamentals , so it has many companies scrambling to bring on zinc exploration and development plays . What I like is that they have huge resources , multiple projects on a huge land package , active JVs and strategic investment through Majors , and their permitting in place . It may take until the summer to get a life , but I got a starter position going , and like having a fishing pole in that pond . <p> When these commodity frenzies start up ( like Iron , Copper , Lithium , Cobalt , and Zinc etc ) my instincts are typically to first go with companies that were specializing in the sector BEFORE it got hot . I like when a company really understands mining a certain commodity and has put in the learning curve when times were tough and survived the downturn . When the cycle turns and their commodity is now in demand , then they have a more advanced project and a leg up on the " Me Toos " . <p> Conversely , I also typically want to sprinkle in a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the shareprice appreciation froth if they have good geology and have a few good drill holes ( like Tinka the last few weeks ) .

It is totally trivial compared with the cost of development , so I 'm not sure it is meaningful . <p> A lot of capital is going to be sucked up by the development and some of that might have been used to advance many smaller projects , so perhaps the Maven is spinning a good light on the collaboration . <p> On April 6 , 2017 at 12:02 am , Excelsiorsays : <p> I actually thought The Resource Maven bought up a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going BIG " on those Copper/Gold projects .

We used to see 50%-80% premiums on takeovers , so it is nice to see more of a premium going to the Jr miners again so that current shareholders get rewarded when positioning in a company that gets acquired . It does shine a good light on the sector and this recent Goldcorp &amp; Barrick JV , but their deal is a pretty good bell-weather deal for the industry . <p> Here is another example of Barrick partnering with other companies , and I have to say the collaboration makes a lot of sense and is very encouraging .

He had it originally posted for subscribers-only earlier in the week but has decided to open it up to the public . Humility is a tough one ( I know it is for me anyway ) when dealing with emotions . But losing money on a trade is even harder . <p> WMK GDXJ did pull back some this morning , but did n't  fill the Gap up on Wednesday .

Its " sell the rally " time . <p> On May 18 , 2015 at 5:41 pm , Shadsays : <p> Good thoughts Original JJ . Well have to see when the dollar will put in the mid-term bottom , and Ive waiting on 92 for the greenback since the beginning of April when I realized it was not going to move higher at that time . That is where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn , but if it gives way then I would n't think it would go much lower , but would n't rule out $89.50 . <p> I agree with Gary that if the dollar turned last Thursday/Friday , then that was n't as harsh of a correction as was expected , and this will limit the strength of the rebound . Personally , I 'm still thinking the dollar has a little further to drop before starting to head higher , and as stated at the end of last week , I think we 've still got a little further to run with PMs and the miners . <p> Good luck to all in their investing in these wild markets ! <p> There are some very intelligent people I respect that feel the dollar will not get back up to test the 100.39 March 11 and March 13th highs . I am still in the camp that it will try to take out these highs and possibly go higher in the late summer/early fall ( capped around 110 ) . In general I agree with Garys outlook he shared on the blog today ; however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the investment world , there is some solid reasoning that the March highs in the dollar were the blow off top . I 'm just not sold on that idea quite yet , but do think the dollar is in definite trouble on the global scene and its days are numbered . <p> On May 18 , 2015 at 6:19 pm , Shadsays : <p> The other key thing I am watching is for oil to get just a little higher up to the $64-$66 range . This is where I expect it to turn , and think this will be dollar index at 92 . <p> My first resistance target in Gold is $1238-1239 ( specifically 1238.20 ) and has been for 2 months , but we have a good chance of taking that out in the near future . Next resistance is $1252.30 , then $1280 is a more serious ceiling . Docs call for $1255 seems the most plausible to me and is very close to that $1252.30 target I have . <p> On May 18 , 2015 at 6:58 pm , Shadsays : <p> Actually , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've wanted to see Gold take out was $1221-$1222 and it has , and then the secondary resistance at $1225 . Those are both bullish for the metal , but I 've been waiting for $1239 to be taken out to the upside in Gold since March , and it looks like we may be getting close to making that happen . $1252.30 is the target I 'd watch carefully for a top in Gold if we do take out 1239 . <p> On May 18 , 2015 at 1:48 pm , Al Korelinsays : <p> Man , I wish I understood what you guys are talking about .

@@120400152 @9400152/ <h> Avi Gilburt Sun 20 Jul , 2014 <h> Weekend Thoughts on Gold and Silver from Avi Gilburt <h> Silver &amp; Gold : Strap Yourself In " It Will Likely Be A Wild Ride <p> 120to144MinChart , Metals <p> With the GLD closing in the 129 region before we came into this week , I provided you with the following warnings , despite the extreme bullishness that seemed pervasive in the media , as well as on our site : <p> As the market moved a bit higher this past week , it is clearly losing strength , at least based upon the technicals , which are registering negative divergences. - For those willing to listen to the clear market signs of a weakening rally , you would be smart in taking some off the table if you entered on the long side with me in the 121.75 region in GLD . <p> But , for the upcoming week , I have to be honest and tell you that I am very torn. - While I have been accurately and correctly warning of the potential whipsaw action we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I still see the potential for further downside followed by another move higher , I can not confidently maintain the perspective that there is more action to be seen in the e-wave of the triangle due to the pattern I see in GLD , in addition to the action we had in silver this past week . <p> Let me start by explaining where we have come from in GLD and then take it forward with my ideal expectations , and then tell you why I have problems with it from the perspective I see in in the set ups in both GLD and silver . But , I must warn all those new to Elliott Wave , the analysis I am about to undergo is a very technical one based upon Elliott Wave structures . <p> Within the last two weeks , my ideal scenario has been to see a larger degree b-wave drop towards the 121-123 region , followed by a rally back to the 130 region to complete the larger e-wave. - This would mean that I was expecting the first drop from the highs to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the b-wave , followed by a corrective rally , into a 5 wave ( c ) wave decline . <p> However , the drop from the highs last week was a relatively clear 5 wave decline. - While the ( a ) wave can certainly be a 5 wave structure , that is a much less common occurrence , as they are most often 3-wave structures . This is the first problem I have with looking for a high probability lower b-wave . <p> To deal with this issue , I have noted the potential for the 5-wave drop to be a c-wave in an expanded flat structure for the ( a ) wave of the b-wave to the 121-123 region. - However , I do n't recall seeing one in a triangle pattern before , which means that it may not be reasonable to rely upon such a structure. - So , while this does somewhat address the first issue I have with expecting any further declines to be the ( c ) wave within a larger degree b-wave , it is clearly not something I can rely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The next issue is presented in the rise we saw- on Thursday. - Right before we broke through resistance , I sent out a Wave Alert noting that the 127.50 level is going to be a very important resistance point through which the GLD will have to break for us to consider that a drop to the 121-123 region may be out of the question. - As we now know , the 127.50 level stopped us dead in our tracks twice , as the GLD dropped down in 5 waves after hitting that level a second time. - This 5 wave downside structure , followed by what seemed to be a corrective rise- on Friday , indicates that further downside will be seen early this coming week , unless we are able to break through the 127.50 level . <p> So , from an Elliott Wave perspective , we have the potential for a i-ii , 1-2 set up in place in GLD , with the heart of a wave iii about to take hold. - This is the second issue I have with the potential for the 121-123 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact , wave ii stopped exactly at the .618 retracement level ( 127.50 ) which is the most common retracement for a wave ii ( but it is also the most common retracement target for a ( b ) wave as well ) . <p> So , while all signs seems to point to the next move in GLD being down towards the 121-123 region early next week , the analysis presented above is why I am considering that the e-wave has potentially completed , and the next drop may not find support in the 121-123 region. - The question will be if we see 5 waves right into that region , or if something much stronger to the downside will take hold to easily take out that region as support. - Remember , a break down below the 119/120 support region opens the door to us being in our 5th- wave down in the metals , targeting a minimum region of 95-105GLD . <p> This now brings me to a discussion of silver . My ideal scenario , once we broke out in silver , was for us to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ region , while completing 5 waves up off the recent lows in a c-wave of a larger degree y-wave. - However , as one of our astute members pointed out , there is a fractal in silver from earlier this year which is very hard to ignore , which called for the last spike we had in silver to be the top before further declines take hold. - And , so far , the market is following this fractal almost perfectly. - This fractal in silver is the third issue I have with seeing higher levels in metals before the bigger decline begins , as it is now clearly pointing towards the market heading down in a big way , after having topped exactly as we did earlier this year " with a spike and strong reversal . <p> The fourth and final issue I have with higher highs is that silver developed a relatively clear 5 wave structure to the downside from its fractal top , followed by a clear 3 wave structure to the upside. - - On Friday , it then developed another 5 wave structure to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and both now seem to be working on a corrective rise. - This means that silver and gold now have potential i-ii , 1-2 pattern set ups pointing us straight down in a 3rd- wave lower. - Silver 's minimum target right now seems to be the 17 region . <p> Of course , I can always force myself to view both these structures as just developing further set ups for higher levels in a more complex structure , but I believe that would be doing all that read my analysis a complete disservice. - That would have you looking up when the market has very clear signals that we should be looking down right now , from a probability perspective , and even further down than we had expected last week . <p> The main reason I wrote this article is that some 4th- wave consolidations are so complex that it is hard to discern when they have truly completed , as we do not often see strong signals of its completion. - While I still believe that this article presents you with the safest perspective in trading out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metals market has now given us fairly strong signals that this larger degree 4th- wave may very well have completed , and we should not be surprised to see us heading to lower lows quite quickly . <p> To summarize , based upon the set-up we now have on the table , - as long as the GLD remains below the 127.50 level and silver remains below the 21.30 level , I am looking down towards the 121-123 region in GLD , which is what I will now be using to gauge the market action. - Depending upon how we move into that region , it should give us indications as to whether that region will hold as support in a larger b-wave of this e-wave of the larger degree triangle. - However , due to the potential for both metals being set-up for the heart of a 3rd- wave down , in addition to silver following its fractal almost perfectly , I am not at all confident that this region will be maintained as support , and there is strong potential that we have begun our 5th- wave to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should the market take out the 127.50 level in the GLD , I will clearly be in the larger 4th- wave camp , as long as we remain below the 139 level in GLD , as discussed last weekend , but with a questioning eye towards a larger downside set up . 216618 @qwx1076618 <p> Wasnt there a big short sale in the early Friday morning the day after the plane crash and the rise in gold ? <p> On July 20 , 2014 at 9:04 pm , Birdmansays : <p> On the daily , gold is showing a minor double top . That will have to resolve itself . Avi has a point here but silver is less decisive in my opinion and bears watching more closely . Meanwhile I still believe stocks are looking to begin correcting this week for my summer pullback . <p> 1 . ) Prior Trend : With any reversal pattern , there must be an existing trend to reverse . In the case of the Double Top Reversal , a significant uptrend of several months should be in place . <p> 2 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highest point of the current trend . As such , the first peak is fairly normal and the uptrend is not in jeopardy ( or in question ) at this time . <p> 3 . ) Trough : After the first peak , a decline takes place that typically ranges from 10 to 20% . Volume on the decline from the first peak is usually inconsequential . The lows are sometimes rounded or drawn out a bit , which can be a sign of tepid demand . <p> 4 . ) Second Peak : The advance off the lows usually occurs with low volume and meets resistance from the previous high . Resistance from the previous high should be expected . Even after meeting resistance , only the possibility of a Double Top Reversal exists . The pattern still needs to be confirmed . The time period between peaks can vary from a few weeks to many months , with the norm being 1-3 months . While exact peaks are preferable , there is some leeway . Usually a peak within 3% of the previous high is adequate . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : <p> Seems I was actually looking at the platinum chart when I wrote that . Ha !

Technicals do not see everything and so can not be relied upon at all times . Not by a long shot . There is far too much room for differing views on what each pattern is suggesting and that is proven by the widely varying opinions expressed by different analysts using the exact same charts .

Furthermore , we have seen these types of spikes down in the futures in other markets , which have only been later confirmed by the cash markets dropping to the same levels at later times .

I ca n't help but wonder if this vicious rally from October was a last chance effort for funds to capture beginning of the 2014 year prices to finish the year . I just ca n't determine whether this is the daily cycle low or not . I have a feeling that the market will rise into the FEDs meeting , SPX 2100 and a sell the news event that follows , which will be a major profit taking event for the year . Let 's see the close today if the gains can hold . GDX : This should set up a new range for a while creating a lot of uncertainty . The only factor that I am working with right now is the prior low of 16.54 . I am working on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerned with the noise in between . The miners could rocket higher or stagnate in here . And of course , they could go to new lows . I would say that if the GDX can not capture 20.42 by Friday , we would be looking to go back to 17 area . But like you said , it will probably be run up to the 21/22 area prior to a sell-down toward the 17 area to trap late comers to the party . Without forming new lows , this would be bullish . <p> Best regards , Richard <p> On December 11 , 2014 at 9:26 am , garysays : <p> Doc , Its too late in the daily cycle for the stock market to go back down . If its forming a bottom here , and it looks like it is , then we have another 25-35 days before the next top . This will be the opportunity to hit Nasdaq 5100 . <p> On December 11 , 2014 at 9:39 am , stewiesays : <p> Perfect timing then Gary . That will put pressure on gold and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level . That will bring very top in Naz and very bottom in gold . Any time frame on that move Gary ? .

Other half got sold day monday after hours when miners did not explode . Im may not even hedge . I will just wait for final bottom with my 1/2 position and load up on 3x funds then . : ) ) ) <p> On December 11 , 2014 at 9:53 am , glenfidishsays : <p> Good luck to you stewie .. <p> On December 11 , 2014 at 9:23 am , Jaysays : <p> Thank you for the great interview .

New lows wowsers . As you said miners better move . <p> Took a quick look and I 'd say i 'm all in between 8-10 .. Give it another week if it hits 9/10 scale in . All time monthly lowes sit close to 8ish .. Massive head and shoulders formation dating back many many years .

TLS is still on the table . <p> On December 11 , 2014 at 12:34 pm , Lawrencesays : <p> Dan I think Encana is a long term hold . Its share was depressed due to its all gas exposure and Cenovus took the good oil property . These days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they have n't made any mistake like Cenovus did.Gas might be good bet now since it is used for heating and oil sand extraction .

If one day we get the Northern gate pipeline built , this company will fly . Its dividend is decent . <p> On December 11 , 2014 at 12:36 pm , Lawrencesays : <p> I was waiting for years to buy this stock . <p> On December 11 , 2014 at 12:45 pm , Dan , calgarysays : <p> Thanks Lawrence , that is my take on ECA also .

What a great job . <p> I really do n't  undrstand why all people say that the miners are totally lagging . <p> When I look at Iamgold , Lake Shore Gold , Newmont Mining , Fresnillo , Stillwater Mining , Pan American Silver , Fortuna Silver , Hecla Mining , Barrick Gold , Franco Nevada , Silvercrest , Oceana Gold , B2 Gold , Claude Resources , Avino Silver &amp; Goldand that are the first that come to my mindI see them all up from their recent lows , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Endeavor Silver , is going even lower from last Friday . Should have bought Stillwater , too bad . Well , what I think is that it really has to do with tax loss selling season and that sentiment is just so bad in individual cases that some miners get to irrationally low levels . What someone here on the forum also says is that in some companies stocks the bottoming process is not really over . Frankly , too me it looks a bit like last year around this time . Also there is a lot of crash-talk going on in the financial community . In my opinion this also contributes a lot to it . Also You have to mention that at current gold and silver prices most companies still operate at a loss , and as long as for the institutions the light at the end of the tunnel is so far away they might rather buy other stuff , like retailers do as well . Gary already mentioned it ; they might all think that the conventional stock market is just a bit safer in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

@@120400157 @9400157/ <h> Gold Market Commentary Thu 29 Dec , 2016 <h> Surging US Dollar in 2017 a Catalyst for Gold Bottom <p> Here is a recent article from Jordan Roy-Byrne from TheDailyGold.com . On the recent weekend show Jordan and I spoke about the potential of the spiking US Dollar signaling a bottom for the gold price ( click here to listen to that interview ) . The takeaway however is that for gold to have a sustainable run up the US dollar needs to be putting in a significant top . I guess we will see <p> <p> Gold has suffered recently in the wake of higher real interest rates while the US Dollar , thanks to higher yields has reached a 14-year high . Stronger real rates hurt Gold but so does a stronger US Dollar , which remains the dominant global currency .

It may sound perverse to gold bugs but the sooner the US Dollar climbs and the stronger it gets , the closer Gold could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gold is now officially in its longest bear market ever .

It would need to rise for nearly another year to achieve that feat . The chart below shows that this run in the greenback has more room to rise . The trajectory of the current bull has closely mirrored that of the 1978 to 1985 bull . If that continues then the US Dollar index could reach 110 in the first half of 2017 and 120 by the end of the year . <p> US Dollar Index Bull Analog <p> The two major peaks in the US Dollar ( 1985 and 2001 ) coincided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important to note that essentially all of the price damage to Gold during the corresponding bear markets occurred well before the US Dollar peaked . The chart below was inspired by an article from ReadTheTicker . After Gold 's bottom in 1982 , the US Dollar surged 37% but Gold only penetrated its previous low by 5% . From Gold 's low in 1999 the US Dollar advanced 17% while Gold did not make a new low . <p> US Dollar Index &amp; Gold <p> The bottom line is Gold could be setting up for an epic bottom when the US Dollar becomes strong enough to cause global problems and induce policy more favorable to Gold . History shows that the majority of price damage in Gold bear markets has occurred in the earlier stages of US Dollar bull markets .

The cell could utilize a novel packaging approach in which a flex circuit is directly bonded to multiple , small contact pads by high-speed laser fusion . <p> This integrated approach has two major advantages . First , it eliminates front surface contacts , which are costly and block some incoming light . Secondly , the cell-to-module packaging can be accomplished with low-cost , alignment-tolerant bonding . <p> " While were completing our patent submission , were hesitant to give more details about the new structure , " said Dr. David Levy , Natcores Director of Research and Technology .

Meanwhile if you try to save @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm seriously considering leaving north america in the next 5 years to go to a place where I can still have some liberty . <p> On April 27 , 2015 at 11:43 am , Birdmansays : <p> When you find that place let us all know ! <p> On April 27 , 2015 at 11:27 am , Confusedsays : <p> A cashless society will crush the poor and marginalized members of our society . <p> On April 27 , 2015 at 11:36 am , Birdmansays : <p> Good show guys . No question this is a topic that will occupy us for years to come . <p> You are right Al that its my belief we are essentially already in a cashless society . What other countries do is not so much our concern . It is what happens at home that matters most to us because even if other countries still transacted in cash it would generally be inconvenient to participate and hold their money given all the new restrictions on cash moving across borders . <p> Just thirty five years ago , modern computing was still pretty much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to code on punch cards at UBC back in 1975 ( ? rusty memory , sorry ) . <p> But at that time if you had imagined how supercomputers would predict weather , process credit cards , synthesize music , make war , manage the data of billions of people etc etc.you were just a big , old , fat dreamer because that was all still in the future . <p> Well the future sure came fast , did n't  it ? <p> As I pointed out yesterday , we now live in an age when trillions of dollars of transactions are processed each year . That is just for the US market which means cash is now the smallest part of our money economy . <p> Maybe it is just a comfort thing that cash still exists . We sure do n't  buy much with it anymore . So Cory could be right that it will linger for many years to come and perhaps we will only know the effects of its passing as more and more shops refuse to accept it due to the inconvenience . <p> Banks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each day . Its a hassle and they want extra handling fees to deal with it . And shop keepers are taking the hint ; especially as tax authorities are tending to scrutinize cash businesss more closely these days . <p> So the trend to cashless is already underway . And here is more proof . <p> Tim Cook of Apple reported in an interview on January 27th that 750 banks and Credit Unions across the US had already signed on to Apple Pay and that in just 90 days after the launch , 2 out of every 3 dollars spent on contact-less POS terminals had gone through its system . <p> They also reported there are now 200,000 vending machines , self laundries and parking lots hooked into the Apple Pay system . In other words , expansion and market penetration has been explosive by any standard . <p> Samsung meanwhile has installed more than 13 million point of sale terminals to support its own pay network . That 's a lot of merchants who have decided to give the idea a try and really , it is mind boggling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are already in the midst of the final countdown days to zero paper money . <p> And I agree with LPG on his idea today . The loss of cash means that holding gold and silver as a means to save is a no-brainer . It may just be the most compelling reason to support metals I have heard in years . <p> Let 's just consider that there is a segment of society that saves come hell or high water . They do not care if there is high inflation and they do not care if rates are sub-zero . They are the mattress people and they want their money in their possession and in their cold clammy hands . <p> But who exactly are they ? Well American Express did a survey in late 2014 and discovered that Millennials were the most likely to save physical money outside the bank . Sixty Seven percent of those surveyed said they hid cash in their homes . It is an incredible number . So LPG is on to something here . <p> If just a fraction of those shifted from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I just had a detailed conversation with Al on the matter , so a few things . <p> 1 ) on the topic of cashless/gold , for whoever wants to read a bit more on what was said , there are a few posts under Garys podcast today ( some food for thought , FWIW ) . <p> 2 ) the reason why I see a cashless society ( or the move toward it as it is a process ) as a " gift " for the price of precious metals is the confluence of a ) lack of alternatives to paper cash b ) small ownership of PMs as a %age of total assets for both households and investors and c ) the current price of PMs such as Gold and silver where probably 50% of producers are currently losing money . <p> The thing is that the paradigm and the narrative on precious metals is not conducive for a move up , nor is exactly the current price . BUT . once people will SLOWLY ( its a process ) realize that their cash is TRAPPED within the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take it out of the financial/banking system . <p> By elimination , I believe that what most will favor are equities and precious metals/gems ( stones ) . The main difference between equities and PMs are the absence of counterparty risk for PMs . A big plus for PMs when the narrative starts to shift . <p> Once the public and some investors slowly realize the EMBEDDED risk to their capital/assets of being in the banking system ( and to a certain degree in the financial system ) , THEN the paradigm will start to shift . THEN the narrative will start to be different . THEN the precious metals will start to be bid . <p> As the screw is slowly being turned on households and capital holders in different parts of the world ( EU , USA , Switzerland other countries/regions I cant say but I 'm confident the list is longer than just the EU , USA , Switzerland ) , the risk is shifting more strongly against capital holders of cash in bank accounts and to a certain extent to some bondholders . When the REALIZATION @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it becomes an entirely new narrative/paradigm for the marketplace . When the paradigm shifts , capital flows change , and some forgotten/cheap asset prices start to get a bid again . <p> Just keep in mind its just a process . Things are unlikely to change in one day , one week , or one month . <p> The lowest PM prices over the next few months , the better for me as an investor w. a multiyear time frame in the PM space ( bullion and publicly listed PMs equities ) . The better because it increase my chances on this dissimetry of risk that I perceive in the PM space . <p> It is a bit like those hedge fund managers ( such as Mark Hart ) who bought CDS on Greece in the late 2000s at 10-15bps The risk profile was hugely dissymmetric and in their favor . It took a few months for them to make money on these CDS , but then , it became a 50x slam dunk in their favor in just a few quarters . Before , the narrative/paradigm was that Greece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per gvt bond yield ) was similar/close to the one of Germany . The market was mispricing the risk . When the narrative started to shift because obviously reality had been misperceived for so long ( as reflected by a long mispricing of the risk ) then it was game over and RING RING for Mark Hart and other hedge fund managers who had bet similarly to him . If they had bought the CDS at 40 , 50 or 100bps , they would still have lost made money ( assuming they had held all the way down to 10-15bps ) . But at 10-15bps the cost of insurance , the investment/trade was almost a guarantee of a slam dunk when the narrative would change . <p> That 's why , for the PM space , I like the risk/reward profile . And that 's why I would LOVE to see lower prices for the PM and the equities . To me , it would be like moving from 50bps on Greeces CDS toward 10-15bps . That 's why I still keep a good amount of drypowder and hope for lower prices . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already in gold ( but I have no idea ) and therefore I have a plan , and a plan after the plan . <p> Hope this clarifies my thoughts a little bit . <p> GL to all investing/trading . <p> LPG <p> On April 27 , 2015 at 12:32 pm , RICHARD-DOCsays : <p> LPG , I could n't agree more with your last full paragraph . I 'm like a kid in a candy shop right now and will continue to be that way going forward . The amount I 'm going to allocate toward PM stock shares is now at about 16% and growing . I 'll continue to look for entry points especially during the summer months and in all probability add more at the end of the summer . Then I 'll just sit on the stocks I own and continue to add small amounts on pullbacks . Then when they eventually start to break out on different technicals , I 'll add lower %es of my base amounts as stocks start to move up . The more people that are n't  paying attention to the PM stocks , the better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ April 28 , 2015 at 7:58 am , Shadsays : <p> Agreed Doc . I am in very much the same camp and have a small allocation of around 25% to the select miners I am following but plan on deploying the majority of my funds in the summer or if we get the big washout later this year . Then I 'll be selling some into strength and buying back on the dips . <p> On April 28 , 2015 at 8:01 am , Shadsays : <p> LPG Agreed . Good Plan and the Plan after the Plan . If we get a nice crash in prices for PMs then I 'll get out my shopping list and go to town . <p> There are some quality miners that I keep a small position in just in case the low really was last Nov , but I get the impression the lows are still to come in the next 6 months or sooner . <p> On April 27 , 2015 at 11:46 am , oringinal jjsays : <p> Doc regardless of big up days or big down days gold refuses to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bears <p> We 'd FOMC or US GDP could completely reverse all of todays gains OR give gold and the miners the follow thru that 's much needed especially regarding the miners who are lack luster today giving the lower levels gold and silver bounce from and their % gains <p> The two main drivers behind a cashless society are global governments looking for every TAX cent and more importantly it removes global bank runs as the world goes digital.G7 countries will be cashless <p> On April 27 , 2015 at 12:14 pm , Birdmansays : <p> There is going to be a monster business in laundering money in the coming years as those who have until now held cash and near-cash assets off-the-books seek to legitimize their hoard before we actually go to cashless systems . <p> Once on a fully accountable electronic system nothing will be able to enter anymore without a clear paper trail and record of sources .

Well <p> SHERIFF JOE IS AT IT AGAIN ! <p> Oh , there 's MUCH more to know about Sheriff Joe ! <p> Maricopa County was spending approx. $18 million dollars a year on stray animals , like cats and dogs . Sheriff Joe offered to take the department over , and the County Supervisors said okay . <p> The animal shelters are now all staffed and operated by prisoners . They feed and care for the strays . Every animal in his care is taken out and walked twice daily . He now has prisoners who are experts in animal nutrition and behavior . They give great classes for anyone whod like to adopt an animal . He has literally taken stray dogs off the street , given them to the care of prisoners , and had them place in dog shows . The best part ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million . Teresa and I adopted a Weimaraner from a Maricopa County shelter two years ago . He was neutered and current on all shots , in great health , and even had a microchip inserted the day we got him . Cost us $78 . <p> The prisoners get the benefit of about $0.28 an hour for working , but most would work for free , just to be out of their cells for the day . Most of his budget is for utilities , building maintenance , etc . He pays the prisoners out of the fees collected for adopted animals . <p> I have long wondered when the rest of the country would take a look at the way he runs the jail system and copy some of his ideas . He has a huge farm , donated to the county years ago , where inmates can work , and they grow most of their own fresh vegetables and food , doing all the work and harvesting by hand . <p> He has a pretty good sized hog farm , which provides meat and fertilizer . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and you can buy a living Christmas tree for $6 $8 for the holidays and plant it later . We have six trees in our yard from the prison . <p> Yup , he was re-elected last year with 83% of the vote . Now he s in trouble with the ACLU again . He painted all his buses and vehicles with a mural that has a special hotline phone number painted on it , where you can call and report suspected illegal aliens . Immigrations and Customs Enforcement was n't doing enough in his eyes , so he had 40 deputies trained specifically for enforcing immigration laws , started up his hotline , and bought 4 new buses just for hauling folks back to the border . He s kind of a Git-R-Dun kind of Sheriff . <p> Sheriff Joe Arpaio ( in Arizona ) who created the Tent City Jail : ** He has jail meals down to 40 cents a serving and charges the inmates for them . <p> ** He stopped smoking and porno magazines in the jail . <p> ** Took away their weights . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He started chain gangs so the inmates could do free work on county and city projects . ** Then he started chain gangs for women so he would n't get sued for discrimination . <p> ** He took away cable TV until he found out there was a federal court order that required cable TV for jails , so he hooked up the cable TV again .. BUTonly let in the Disney channel and the Weather channel . <p> ** When asked why the weather channel , he replied , " So they will know how hot its gon na be while they are working on my chain gangs .

" Its inhumane . " <p> Joe Arpaio , the tough-guy sheriff who created the tent city and long ago started making his prisoners wear pink and eat bologna sandwiches , is not one bit sympathetic . He said Wednesday that he told all of the inmates , " Its 120 degrees in Iraq and our soldiers are living in tents too , and they have to wear full battle gear , but they did n't  commit any crimes , so shut your mouths !

I still ca n't believe people take him seriously . Take away the name and he s nothing . Anyhow , I believe the sanctions are going to come and haunt us down the road . The economy is not on equal footing to begin with ; it wo n't take much to blow the house of cards off the table .

Also a couple of days ago ISIS released another video showing decapititation of about 100 Peshmerga POWs they had captured ; with the statement " that anyone who fights against ISIS will be killed " . <p> It is not very surprising , therefore , that Khurdish resistance against ISIS appears to have almost disappeared . The ISIS barbarian jihadists need to be eliminated from the face of the earth , in my humble opinion . ( They are sub-human ) . Satisfy their desire to meet Allah ! In 2005 there were 1.3million Christians in Iraq ; now less than 100,000 and ISIS is determined to reduce that number to ZERO . Obamas actions will come in as too little , too late . I may not be a christian , but I ferventently believe everyone has the right to their own beliefs , AS LOMG AS THEY DO NOT INTERFERE WITH THE HUMAN RIGHTS OF OTHERS . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have noticed the word " shame " being used more often when talking of Harper , due to his support of Israel I believe . His corruption has gotten obvious to more people than generally would notice , from his " I wont touch the income trusts " to the RCMP investigating conservatives . Its possible that people are realising Harper is an American puppet , most Canadians would prefer otherwise , many times the description is " harpers lips are tattooed to Obamas a@#@ " <p> The positive with Justin is he is not Harper , altho people might have disagreed with his father people still understand Justin was raised by a patriot . His stand to legalise marijuana is an indication he has a little common sense I believe and is maybe in " tune " with the population and times .

Do you remember Ignatieff , the ex-pat . Trudeau needs to prove himself instead of riding on his fathers past and the coattails of card carrying liberal idiots . I do n't  think he has proven himself and for his party to make him the leader smacks of governmental patronage . <p> On August 8 , 2014 at 1:17 pm , bbsays : <p> You could be right DT , about all of it , but he is n't Harper .

I always have time for what Peter says because from the first time we met I understood that he keeps emotion completely out of his investing . He is purely technical so for those who do not like reading up on technicals this is probably not the post for you . <p> <p> Happy New Year to you all . <p> The markets have started out with a big bang on the first trading day of 2016 . A review of some charts is in order . <p> I hate to become bearish on days of big weakness and bullish on bulges in the stock indexes , but the global stock indexes are set up in a very ugly way . <p> The daily graph of theMSCI Emerging Market Index is forming a continuation H&amp;S pattern . Support at the 740 level will be extremely important . <p> The major U.S. stock indexes are also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NASDAQ , a rectangle in the Dow and a horn top in the S&amp;Ps . <p> The FTSE also exhibits a continuation H&amp;S pattern . <p> Ditto Singapore . <p> The global stock indexes appear poised to make significant tops but the tops are not yet in and anything can happen in the meanwhile . <p> Swiss Franc futures have successfully retested the overhead symmetrical triangle , although some additional backing and filling may occur . Factor shorted the overnight rally in CHF . <p> USD/SGD has completed a very rare diamond pattern . I continue to emphasize that diamonds are reversal patterns in the vast majority of cases . Continuation diamonds are rare . Factor is long despite this fact , but I will guard my position very carefully . <p> I continue to view the possible H&amp;S bottom in NZD/SEK with great interest . Keep in mind that this must be considered as a coincidental pattern it is hard to imagine a strong global macro reason to be long Kiwi and short Sweden . I will not work this trade in the overnight market for fears of being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it gets . <p> The daily chart of the Dec 2016 Eurodollars ( interest rate , not the currency ) has completed a H&amp;S top . I have my neckline drawn as shown . The rally today retested the neckline . Factor is short , but I am not giving this trade much room to dig into my pockets . The monthly continuation chart of the Eurodollars can only be described with one word UGLY . Support exists at 99.17 ( 83 basis points ) . <p> I have featured and traded the devaluation of the Peso since Oct 2014 . The target remains in the low .05000s on the monthly graph . The daily chart appears to be in the right shoulder of a continuation H&amp;S pattern . Further right shoulder development is possible . I would consider a rally toward .05900 to be a selling opportunity . <p> There is a possibility that the Aussie Dollar is in a bottoming pattern taking the form of an ascending triangle on the daily and weekly charts . There is no doubt but that the burden is on the bulls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bottom might have a chance . <p> Finally , my bearish stance on Soybeans has been continuous and unwaivering for 18 months . I would view a new low in Mar Soybeans as a sign the market will continue to work lower .

I always have time for what Peter says because from the first time we met I understood that he keeps emotion completely out of his investing . He is purely technical so for those who do not like reading up on technicals this is probably not the post for you . <p> <p> Happy New Year to you all . <p> The markets have started out with a big bang on the first trading day of 2016 . A review of some charts is in order . <p> I hate to become bearish on days of big weakness and bullish on bulges in the stock indexes , but the global stock indexes are set up in a very ugly way . <p> The daily graph of theMSCI Emerging Market Index is forming a continuation H&amp;S pattern . Support at the 740 level will be extremely important . <p> The major U.S. stock indexes are also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NASDAQ , a rectangle in the Dow and a horn top in the S&amp;Ps . <p> The FTSE also exhibits a continuation H&amp;S pattern . <p> Ditto Singapore . <p> The global stock indexes appear poised to make significant tops but the tops are not yet in and anything can happen in the meanwhile . <p> Swiss Franc futures have successfully retested the overhead symmetrical triangle , although some additional backing and filling may occur . Factor shorted the overnight rally in CHF . <p> USD/SGD has completed a very rare diamond pattern . I continue to emphasize that diamonds are reversal patterns in the vast majority of cases . Continuation diamonds are rare . Factor is long despite this fact , but I will guard my position very carefully . <p> I continue to view the possible H&amp;S bottom in NZD/SEK with great interest . Keep in mind that this must be considered as a coincidental pattern it is hard to imagine a strong global macro reason to be long Kiwi and short Sweden . I will not work this trade in the overnight market for fears of being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it gets . <p> The daily chart of the Dec 2016 Eurodollars ( interest rate , not the currency ) has completed a H&amp;S top . I have my neckline drawn as shown . The rally today retested the neckline . Factor is short , but I am not giving this trade much room to dig into my pockets . The monthly continuation chart of the Eurodollars can only be described with one word UGLY . Support exists at 99.17 ( 83 basis points ) . <p> I have featured and traded the devaluation of the Peso since Oct 2014 . The target remains in the low .05000s on the monthly graph . The daily chart appears to be in the right shoulder of a continuation H&amp;S pattern . Further right shoulder development is possible . I would consider a rally toward .05900 to be a selling opportunity . <p> There is a possibility that the Aussie Dollar is in a bottoming pattern taking the form of an ascending triangle on the daily and weekly charts . There is no doubt but that the burden is on the bulls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bottom might have a chance . <p> Finally , my bearish stance on Soybeans has been continuous and unwaivering for 18 months . I would view a new low in Mar Soybeans as a sign the market will continue to work lower .

I base this on the stochastics , which are well under 50 and not yet oversold and the MACD which is on the cusp of rolling over . Now , it is certainly possible that the miners bottom before hitting oversold stochastics and without the MACD turning negative , but I would not bank on it . I have to say , I am not expecting a huge breakdown at this point given how far away the lower monthly bollinger band still is ( 20,2 ) . On the flip side , the ichimoku cloud lower border is fast approaching , so I think the miners will have to make up their mind by June/July . Well see .

Absolutely . There 's no question about it . That 's not just an opinion . <p> There is statistical evidence piling up to make the case , in addition to anecdotal evidence and forensic evidence . The evidence is very clear , in fact . <p> I 've spoken to members of Congress . I 've spoken to people in the intelligence community , in the defense community , very senior people at the IMF . I do n't believe in making strong claims without strong evidence , and the evidence is all there . <p> I spoke to a PhD statistician who works for one of the biggest hedge funds in the world . I ca n't mention the fund 's name but it 's a household name . You 've probably heard of it . He looked at COMEX @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ COMEX closing prices for a 10-year period . He was dumbfounded . <p> He said it was is the most blatant case of manipulation he 'd ever seen .

She is the leading expert on globe price manipulation . She actually testifies in gold price manipulation cases that are going on . <p> She wrote a report reaching the same conclusions . It 's not just an opinion , it 's not just a deep , dark conspiracy theory . Here 's a PhD statistician and a prominent market expert lawyer , expert witness in litigation qualified by the courts , who independently reached the same conclusion .

He provides his reasons why he thinks gold will take out the highs of this year in the first half of 2017 . <p> I 'm not so sure about gold hitting its 2016 highs in early 2017 but anything is possible in the sea of change were witnessing politically . I do n't  disagree with Neds outlook . Things will be bumpy for sure in gold one way or another . But overall I believe were headed towards and breaking $1000 at some point soon/2017 . <p> If capital outflows in Chona start to accelerate due to a U.S. interest rate hike and China eventually hints at some type of gold restrictions , look out ! <p> India , for now , is in the spotlight and in rarefied territory with over 1 billion pissed off citizens who wont give up their gold easily . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Posted Dec 9 , 2016 by Martin Armstrong <p> India is moving now to confiscate gold after going after the cash .

Too good to be true but this is a strong period and money is rushing in to buy the momentum up to the end of the year and then a big sharp correction could start at the beginning of January once people realize they have huge profits and it cant go higher so they rush for the exits and it could last a few weeks and then a another good run Feb to April . <p> On December 8 , 2016 at 3:10 pm , Matthewsays : <p> I wont argue that it cant get more overbought , that 's for sure . And after the daily chart gets a little " reset " technically , it just might head even higher . What I am confident about , is that the miners will dramatically outperform conventional stocks next year . <p> On December @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Gold should take off in January when the S&amp;P falls hard from 2350 down to 2200 or lower . <p> On December 8 , 2016 at 4:09 pm , Matthewsays : <p> Thanks .

He thinks stocks will go much higher . <p> On December 8 , 2016 at 4:13 pm , Matthewsays : <p> No , I 'll have to take a look .

As a backer of pm fundamentals , it pains me to say that . Ca n't avoid the truth though just because it does n't  suit <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : <p> What about taking out this years highs by the 4th quarter of 2017 ? <p> That seems like a reasonable position to me . <p> On December 8 , 2016 at 5:02 pm , Ozibatlasays : <p> Yeh by the 4th quarter is a better bet i recon . Looking 12 months ahead is fraught with danger though . Too many surprises and unforseen events unfolding or not . Who knows , gold be above 1500 this time nxt year ( probably not at this stage ) . The question we need to ask , What factor could drive gold back to its bull market support area in the mid $1500 range ? <p> On December 9 , 2016 at 7:06 am , Excelsiorsays : <p> There are a few different drivers that could play into 2017 : <p> 1 ) It may be the realization by the market next year , that after this Dec rate hike , and maybe the Fed can squeeze one more off in March , but after that , the debt load will not allow interest rates to go much higher than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest of the markets realize the central banks have painted themselves in a corner . <p> 2 ) The war on cash will keep some global investors interested in Gold , and crypto currencies as another place to store wealth . <p> 3 ) Europe will become more a train wreck next year and people may want a way of diversifying out of the Euro , so this may lift other currencies and Gold in tandem . <p> 4 ) The overly complacent market participants and the Wall Wtreet traders ( many of whom are so young they may only remember the 2008/2009 correction and think it was a fluke ) may finally experience fear if there is a general market sell-off next year . The question will be how the computer " circuit breakers " would act in a liquidation event . <p> 5 ) All this change may also break down patterns and correlations in a way where the algos and computer buying/selling zigs when it should zag . This will only confuse market participants , and add to the volatility . <p> 6 ) When the honeymoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a recession , fear will enter the market again , and Gold &amp; Silver may look interesting to have 5-10% of an allocation in for protection purposes . <p> There are a few thoughts , but of course , nobody knows anything and nobody has a crystal ball . Based on longer term monthly charts though , it would not surprise me to see Gold reach new highs by the 3rd quarter of 2017 , and this is in alignment with what Docs been discussing with us for some time . <p> On December 9 , 2016 at 7:09 am , Excelsiorsays : <p> Wall Wtreet = Wall Street <p> On December 9 , 2016 at 7:34 am , Ozibatlasays : <p> Excelsior , I think your first reason is most pertinent . With debt levels increasing at current rate , how can an increasing interest rate co-exist without repayment increase problems ? ? ! <p> On December 8 , 2016 at 2:55 pm , Paul L.says : <p> I do n't  follow gold that much but it would need a long time to get to the last high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could easily go down to test 1100 first especially since the strong period is over . <p> On December 8 , 2016 at 3:06 pm , James the lessersays : <p> GH , I am back by popular request . <p> There needs to be a balance here . If everyone was a gold to the mooner what would be the fun in that . <p> Just ignore me . <p> On December 8 , 2016 at 3:16 pm , GHsays : <p> I agree diversity in viewpoints is good . <p> Its your style I object to . Long on opinion , sound &amp; fury , short on evidence and reasoned argument , and ill-mannered to boot . Ned Schmidt , a seasoned pro , does us the courtesy of giving us some of his time , and you act like a jerk . If you acted at the racetrack the way you act here , I suspect you 'd be a pariah . <p> On December 8 , 2016 at 3:27 pm , Matthewsays : <p> Exactly . <p> On December 9 , 2016 at 2:16 am , Archdeacon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is full of wind . <p> On December 8 , 2016 at 5:05 pm , Ozibatlasays : <p> James just because your opinion is n't popular , does n't  necessarily mean its wrong . I hope it is but only time will . I think your thoughts , if nothing else , offer good perspective from someone who is not long pms . Both sides of the story are invaluable i believe <p> On December 8 , 2016 at 5:24 pm , GHsays : <p> I agree its valuable to have gold bears commenting . <p> Again , its how its done . <p> On December 9 , 2016 at 3:28 am , Robert Moriartysays : <p> Ozibatla : Sorry to burst your bubble but JTL claims to be long PMs . Its hard to know the truth because he tells a lot of tales . <p> There are several guys here who predicted the PM bull in 2016 and got it dead right . For certain there are people here who do have a clue as to where gold is going in 2017 . But it is not JTL , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we know that never happened . <p> JTL is not a gold bear , he s a troll . Big difference between the two . <p> On December 9 , 2016 at 5:32 am , Ozibatlasays : <p> No bubble burst on my end Rob , do n't  worry . Whether James is legit or not was n't my point . I was merely alluding to the fact that it is good to hear both sides of one story . After all , there are bulls and there are bears and they both shape any market . Just trying to get some perspective in this crazy world . <p> On December 9 , 2016 at 5:44 am , Ozibatlasays : <p> At the end of the day I think most who comment here are in agreeance that the world can not continue on its current economic path without disastrous ramifications . Precious metals are ultimately a bet or hedge against debt and inflation i believe . <p> We all want to preserve what wealth we have as best we can right ? I sincerely hope there can be an affective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debt figure can not be avoided , its mathematically certain . Just a question of whether we are alive to witness D-day <p> On December 9 , 2016 at 6:25 am , Robert Moriartysays : <p> OZ : <p> I 'm not sure gold and silver are quite that much a hedge against debt and inflation . If you look at a long term chart of gold , its expensive against everything . I cant say Im right but I think gold carries a big premium against chaos and government stupidity which we have in abundance . Its an insurance policy that we hope we never use . <p> On December 9 , 2016 at 7:28 am , Ozibatlasays : <p> Couldnt agree more Rob on the government stupidity statement . We may hope to never use , but I think it is inevitable . Governments will continue to spend till they are no more . <p> On December 9 , 2016 at 8:01 am , Matthewsays : <p> Yes , but inflation IS government stupidity and gold perfectly protects long term savings from its effects despite what guys like Armstrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Gold is relatively unattractive right now , as Robert stated , but not when compared to U.S. government debt which includes the dollar . <p> On December 9 , 2016 at 9:41 am , Robert Moriartysays : <p> Matthew : <p> I do n't  often disagree with you but if you chart the long term price of gold against all commodities you will realize that actually gold has gone up a lot more than inflation therefore it can not be a hedge against inflation , it already has been more than a hedge . There has to be some other factor . <p> On December 9 , 2016 at 10:43 am , Matthewsays : <p> Robert , it is definitely true that gold leads and lags both money supply increases and the resulting price inflation , but over the long haul , the correlation is clear . <p> Something that is missed by even most gold bugs is the fact that the dollar should not buy what it did 100 years ago , it should buy more . And sound money does just that . The impact of technology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tech are deflationary and that , as YOU know ( and most others do n't  ) is a good thing . I can see why people like Ron Paul do n't  bother pointing this out since people like JTL wont be moved by the fact that the dollar is down more like 99% not 96% ( this means that the dollar would have to quadruple to get up to minus 96% ) . <p> In addition , if gold were just a hedge against government stupidity that is separate from money creation , then its price should be expected to slide back to its starting point after each bout of stupidity has past and the governments actions have returned to their baseline level of stupid . <p> On December 9 , 2016 at 11:12 am , Matthewsays : <p> One more point . If gold is up as much as it is since 2000 because it is a hedge against stupidity , then why is copper , oil , and commodities in general also up substantially ? Real GDP peaked in 1999 so it ca n't be due to real , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than most commodities but that can be explained by the fact that demand for it goes up exactly when demand for the economy-driven commodities goes down . It is due to this that holding just 15% of ones funds in gold can provide the protection that it does . <p> In a big economic bust , gold blows away commodities because cash is king in an economic contraction and gold is cash . Savers get rewarded naturally in a bust , as they should . The central banks undermine the natural order by getting people to believe that the paper claims ( debt ) that they emit is money and the cash that should be held as savings . <p> The better the economy , the more gold is likely to underperform . When risk-taking is getting rewarded , people spend their money in order to take risks . <p> Matthew , I 've been making comments on local talk in Md and other sights for several ( 3-5 ) years disparaging the $USD and calling it the " Ivory Snow Dollar " , meaning virtually as the 60s-70s commercial portrayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some of the old farts here will remember . <p> On December 10 , 2016 at 4:51 am , Martysays : <p> Silver low in 1999 was $4.44 in May <p> On December 8 , 2016 at 3:09 pm , James the lessersays : <p> I do n't  put my money where where my whiny mouth is ? <p> You have no clue and you know it . <p> I offered a bet against the swamp creature and he is hiding in the tall weeds <p> On December 8 , 2016 at 3:12 pm , Matthewsays : <p> All you do is talk gold and silver down but you refuse to sell your substantial holdings . Am I missing something ? <p> On December 8 , 2016 at 3:14 pm , Matthewsays : <p> Imagine what people would think of me if I had spent the bear market talking gold/silver up while staying net short the entire time ? <p> You 're a joke or worse , James . <p> On December 9 , 2016 at 3:30 am , Robert Moriartysays : <p> JTL : <p> I 've already shown that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so if you are not going to lie about the bet as well , send AL a check for $1000 because while you claimed to have bought silver in 1999 , you did n't  even know when it hit its low . <p> On December 8 , 2016 at 4:14 pm , GHsays : <p> I found Neds comment on the Nasdaq 100 ( $NDX ) interesting . I 've always followed $COMPQ . Can anyone she 'd any light on the differences and relative advantage of following one versus the other ? <p> Thats two Raff regression channels , in green and black , and a rising wedge in blue . <p> On December 8 , 2016 at 4:38 pm , Matthewsays : <p> I think that looking at the top 100 will give you a better idea about the true overall health of the sector but I would probably look at both . Divergences and confirmations can be useful . I noticed that $COMPQ took out its 2008 low in early 2009 before going higher while $NDX did not , and the same thing happened with the 2015/16 lows . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sector would be less volatile and would see more buying interest sooner during a retest of what had been a scary low . <p> On December 8 , 2016 at 5:25 pm , GHsays : <p> That makes sense . Thanks , Matthew . <p> On December 8 , 2016 at 4:15 pm , Paul Wsays : <p> Ned Schmidt is a gem . If you are talking him on the weekend show , please ask him if he has any opinion on Input Capital .

The long position has almost certainly grown further over the last couple of days . <p> Its tempting to dismiss this move as another tremor from the Trump election earthquake with a falling dollar the transmission mechanism . But copper began breaking upwards several days ago when markets were still pricing in a Hillary Clinton victory . <p> So what 's going on ? And what happened to that big supply surplus which has kept copper boxed in below $5,000 since the start of 2016 ? <p> BALANCED MARKET ? <p> What trades on the LME and other exchanges such as CME and the Shanghai Futures Exchange ( ShFE ) is refined copper . <p> And the refined metal part of the copper supply chain is in essence balanced between supply and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the view of both the International Copper Study Group ( ICSG ) and the International Wrought Copper Council ( IWCC ) . <p> The ICSG assessment is that the global market will record an 8,000-tonne supply-demand shortfall this year before moving to a 163,000-tonne surplus next year . <p> The IWCC is forecasting a cumulative 180,000-tonne surplus over the same two-year period . <p> In the context of a 23 million-tonne global market , the difference between the two is no more than a rounding error . <p> The ICSG has tweaked its numbers since its last forecast in March . It has lifted its estimate of 2016 refined production growth from 0.5 percent to 2.2 percent , slightly higher than the IWCCs 2.0 percent assessment . <p> But , critically , the ICSG has also raised its usage forecast for this year from 0.5 percent to 1.5 percent , largely reflecting the pace of " apparent " usage growth in China . <p> " Apparent " usage is a statistical hall of mirrors , based as it is on what can be counted and not necessarily on what really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The Group concedes that " real " demand growth in China may be closer to 4.0 percent this year , chiming with the IWCCs forecast of 4.1 percent growth . <p> The higher figure also tallies with the broad consensus among analysts , who have collectively upgraded their own Chinese demand expectations after the early-year government stimulus , channeled as ever through construction and infrastructure spend . <p> The " apparent " usage methodology is founded on " hard " figures such as Chinas imports and exports . <p> And these have fluctuated wildly over the last year . <p> Imports boomed over the November 2015-April 2016 period . The cumulative tally was 2.23 million tonnes . <p> To put that into perspective , they were running at an annualized pace of almost 4.5 million tonnes , which would have far exceeded even last calendar years record 3.7 million tonnes . <p> Then exports surged over the May-August period . At a cumulative 260,000 tonnes they were running at an annualized pace of 780,000 tonnes . The previous high for any calendar year was 293,000 tonnes in 2013 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ShFE have reflected this ebb and flow . <p> LME stocks fell to an 18-month low of 141,075 tonnes at the beginning of April . ShFE stocks , by contrast , soared to an all-time high of 394,777 tonnes in March . <p> As the import-export pendulum turned , LME stocks rebounded to 379,165 tonnes in late September . ShFE stocks have slumped to just 97,839 tonnes . <p> The pendulum appears to be swinging again with LME cancellations and outflows running at accelerated levels . <p> But its increasingly clear that these apparently contradictory signals have reflected no more than a convoluted roundabout with physical traders arbitraging the two markets , playing with a mix of futures spreads , physical premiums and warehouse incentives . <p> Stock movements , so closely watched by the market for clues as to supply-demand balance , have generated only noise this year . <p> As of the end of October the net year-to-date movement in all global exchange copper stocks , LME , ShFE and the CME warehouse system , has been a rise of just 22,500 tonnes . <p> Which would seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still is " broadly balanced " , to quote the IWCC . <p> HIDDEN SURPLUS <p> Which does n't  mean there has n't  been a shift to surplus dynamics in the copper market . <p> Its just that its taken place in a different part of the supply chain . <p> Mine supply of copper concentrates , excluding straight-to-metal operations using leach technology , is on course to grow by around 6 percent this year , according to the ICSG . <p> And that calculation includes an allowance for unexpected disruptions , which until the last month or so were running at an unexpectedly slow pace . <p> Its no secret where all that extra supply has been going . <p> Chinas imports of copper concentrates surged by 31 percent to 12.2 million tonnes ( bulk weight ) in the first nine months of this year . And the year-ago period itself represented a record pace of import . <p> The country is now the worlds largest refined copper producer as well as its largest user and its smelters have been soaking up raw materials surplus . <p> Chinese refined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the year , according to the National Bureau of Statistics . <p> The problem is no-one fully trusts these figures . Moreover , given the rate of increase in imports , the headline increase looks on the low side . <p> Have Chinas smelters been refilling stocks depleted by years of mine shortfall ? Will they convert inventory into refined production next year ? <p> Difficult questions to answer . Even by the shadowy standards of copper market statistics , what 's going on at the concentrate stocks part of the supply chain is a very dark place indeed . <p> What is clear right now is that the market , or at least the fund part of it , has shifted its collective view about the size and impact of the much discussed wall of copper supply . <p> Because beyond the shadowy statistics and the misleading stock movements , the truest signal is the price . <p> ( The opinions expressed here are those of the author , a columnist for Reuters )

( TSX VENTURE:CX ) ( " CarbonOne " or the " Company " ) , formerly Palo Duro Energy Inc . ( TSX VENTURE:PDE.H ) , is pleased to announce that it has completed its previously announced business combination ( the " Transaction " ) with CarbonOne Holdings Corp . ( " CarbonOne Holdings " ) and Tapango Resources Ltd . ( TSX VENTURE:TPA.H ) ( " Tapango " ) . CarbonOnes common shares commenced trading on the TSX Venture Exchange ( " TSX-V " ) under the symbol " CX " at the opening of trading today . <p> About CarbonOne Technologies Inc . <p> CarbonOne , through its subsidiaries , is engaged in the development , production , manufacturing and commercialization of advanced materials .

CarbonOnes products have disruptive implications in a number of industries , competing with traditional materials including wood , metal , concrete , panel insulation and plastic . CarbonOne has established a research and development and manufacturing facility in Buffalo , NY , allowing the Company to commercialize existing products and advance new products to launch in the future . <p> CarbonOne will focus initially on two products : C1Bar and C1Board . C1Bar is a composite rebar that is lighter than steel yet has stronger tensile strength than steel . C1Bar is also corrosion proof , providing an important advantage for outdoor applications where rusting rebar is a significant concern , and resulting in a product with a longer expected lifespan than steel rebar . CarbonOnes integrated approach to manufacturing composite rebar allows the Company to quickly and cost-effectively manufacture a high-quality product that outperforms its competitors on both a performance and cost perspective . <p> C1Board is a carbon ceramic composite panel with potential application across a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yet lighter than plywood . It is fire proof , insect proof and rot proof , and impervious to water , mold and mildew . C1Board is also insulative . The primary near-term application for C1Board is as a competitor to marine grade plywood . CarbonOne has developed and manufactured test runs of C1Board that could compete with the marine grade plywood used in the production of recreational vehicles , delivery vans , utility trailers , buses and modular homes . With some minor manufacturing modifications , C1Board could also be used for shipping containers and shipping pallets . <p> " CarbonOne offers investors a compelling entry point to the advanced materials market , with an experienced team and innovative , disruptive products with applications across a range of industries , " said John Proust , Chairman and CEO of CarbonOne .

Does this current decline , match up chart wise with their template ? If so , what would the expected bottom of this current B Decline be ? TIA <p> Wolfster , you asked me over the weekend about Molybdenum , and I did post a few ideas there , but I just saw another company ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Merlin Project : <p> The Merlin Project is based on the worlds highest grade molybdenum and rhenium deposit , discovered by the Company in late 2008 with an initial Mineral Resource announced in mid-2009 . The project has successfully progressed through the scoping , pre-feasibility and feasibility study phases . The key strengths of the project include the high-grade of the resource and relatively shallow depth , which results in a project with forecast strong long-term cash flows and substantial project returns . <p> I have n't done much research into it yet and have been reviewing different Copper/Gold companies , but when I saw the Molybdenum comments it made me think of this weekends discussion so I thought I 'd mention it . <p> " Rodney Lamond , President and Chief Executive Officer of Jaguar , stated : " Todays reported high-grade intercepts continue to confirm a strong mineralized system down-plunge of current Mineral Reserves at Pilar , in particular the high-grade intercepts related to the newly discovered BFII ore body . These results provide excellent potential for higher grades , the increase of Mineral Resources , and the conversion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been very pleased with our operations at Pilar where our average grade has steadily increased and we are on track to achieve our production guidance for 2016 .

Why ? the new silver grades @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to convert silver grades in terms of gold , and the gold equivalent ( based on silver grades ) of less than 5 grams/t do not really interest me . Do n't  get me wrong , Avino is a solid company , but I 'd rather have more shares in Alexco , Brixton , Excellon , Impact , and even Americas , before Avino . Eventually , it will be about getting high grades with 90% recovery and making a profit ( think P/E , etc ) . Just my thoughts on balancing our silver PM holdings Brian <p> On September 27 , 2016 at 7:06 am , Excelsiorsays : <p> Good thoughts Brian . <p> Yes it is very hard to go wrong with Alexco , Brixton , Excellon , Impact , and Americas Silver corp . I have positions in them as well ( except Excellon , but it is on my short list ) . <p> I hold Avino for more of a stable and steady growth story , that I believe will grow into a respectable mid tier mining company over the next 2 years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their off-take agreement with Samsung , which underpins their projects . You are correct that their resource has never been the highest grade , but economics of the resource are more important that the actual grade . Brent Cook has made that point many times there are very low grade resources that are simply more economic than some high-grade resources , due to their depth , site access , infrastructure , power requirements , how far does the ore need to be transported , etc For example , Alexco has really high grade , but it is far more remote , and they have the Silver Wheaton and Sandstorm streams eating into any revenues they may generate , so that knocks the profitability back down some . <p> With Avino , I consider them a very well run " family business " that is n't going to collapse or go out of business any time soon . Also , they keep extending the mine life on it even as they are mining it because most of their mountain of resources is not included in their official reserve estimates yet . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount of exploration upside around Avinio and San Gonzalo . <p> There is also the upside in costs and access to the ease of mining their old Oxide tailings to consider as well . Mining the old tailings will make it easier to drop their AISC when that is mixed in with the other ore in 2017-2022 . <p> Lastly , the marketplace is n't giving them any value for Bralorne yet , and that may be their high grade Gold/Silver surprise to the marketplace . <p> On September 27 , 2016 at 7:31 am , JohnKsays : <p> The Urban Barry is getting interesting . Osisko mining is the big dog in the area , and I would n't be surprised to see them make a play for Mentanor . Beaufield is there and they should be releasing drill results pretty soon . Bonterra did a 10,000 meter drill and they should be coming out with results soon . Toma gold also has a property next to Osisko . This is being toted as Quebecs next gold camp . With Osisko and Eric Sprott involved , this becomes a real nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 2016 at 7:50 am , Excelsiorsays : <p> Agreed . Ive been following Metanor and Bonterra with interest , but have n't really spent much time on Toma Gold . Ill look into this a bit more closely .

I do think pension funds will be looking for yield and seek out dividend paying stocks . Not a bad place to be , but there are a number of companys that my have to lower their dividends in 2015 because they are not as solid as their stock prices may indicate . 2015 will be the year we start seeing in certain sectors a number of household names in trouble . <p> In a addition , you are both so right about it being a stock-pickers market . As far as that relates to the miners , I am most comfortable currently with specific companies in 3 groups of miners : <p> 1 ) My favorite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mines , UPSIDE improving economics and cost containment , UPSIDE from their exploration targets , and management with a track record . Most of these stocks are insanely undervalued , and later this year and into 2016 the marketplace will re-rate these . <p> 2 ) Streaming companies I think this business model , the success , and the ability to survive tough markets due to residual income streams from Royalties and Streaming Agreements are a must . ( Silver Wheaton , Royal Gold , Sandstorm Gold , and Franco Nevada are the main players but there are new companies forming ) <p> 3 ) Exploration and Project Generating companies In this group there are just too many and most will fail or just do n't  have the ability to raise money in these markets and 90% will be out of business in 10 years . However , there are a few gems in this bunch that will have the largest percentage gains , and will either be bought out or have one of their projects purchased by Mid-tier producers or Majors . The few good companies with good projects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studies completed or near-completed , $3-$10 million in cash to survive the next few years , and especially ones in a Joint-Venture situation or some partnership with a larger Mid-Tier or Major already . Many of these are priced so low it makes your head turn to do the math , on stock price versus ounces in the ground/cost to pull metals out of the ground . Some are sitting on a fortune , and will be take-out targets later this year and next . Exeter and International Tower Hill Mines come to mind . <p> On January 31 , 2015 at 7:06 am , Shadsays : <p> I should clarify that Exeter and International Tower Hill Mines really do n't  have the partnerships with Majors at this point , ( but everyone is watching their deposits grow and know theyll be up for grabs soon ) .

@@120400296 @9400296/ <h> the Horrors of Communist China by Lou Rockwell . <h> The Horrors of Communist China <p> Its a scandal that few Westerners are even aware , or , if they are aware , they are not conscious , of the bloody reality that prevailed in China between the years 1949 and 1976 , the years of communist rule by Mao Zedong . <p> How many died as a result of persecutions and the policies of Mao ? Perhaps you care to guess ? Many people over the years have attempted to guess . But they have always underestimated . As more data rolled in during the 1980s and 1990s , and specialists have devoted themselves to investigations and estimates , the figures have become ever more reliable . And yet they remain imprecise . What kind of error term are we talking about ? It could be as low as 40 million . It could be as high as 100 million or more . In the Great Leap Forward from 1959 to 1961 alone , figures range between 20 million to 75 million . In the period before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of millions more . <p> As scholars in the area of mass death point out , most of us cant imagine 100 dead or 1000 . Above that , we are just talking about statistics : they have no conceptual meaning for us , and it becomes a numbers game that distracts us from the horror itself . And there is only so much ghastly information that our brains can absorb , only so much blood we can imagine . And yet there is more to why Chinas communist experiment remains a hidden fact : it makes a decisive case against government power , one even more compelling than the cases of Russia or Germany in the 20th century . <p> The horror was foreshadowed in a bloody civil war following the Second World War . After some nine million people died , the communists emerged victorious in 1949 , with Mao as the ruler . The land of Lao-Tzu ( rhyme , rhythm , peace ) , Taoism ( compassion , moderation , humility ) , and Confucianism ( piety , social harmony , individual development ) was seized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germany via Russia . It was an ideology that denied all logic , experience , economic law , property rights , and limits on the power of the state on grounds that these notions were merely bourgeois prejudices , and what we needed to transformed society was a cadre with all power to transform all things . <p> Its bizarre to think about it , really : posters of Marx and Lenin in China , of all places , and rule by an ideology of robbery , dictatorship , and death that did not come to an end until 1976 . So spectacular has the transformation been in the last 25 years that one would hardly know that any of this ever happened , except that the Communist Party is still running the place while having tossed out the communist part . <p> The experiment began in the most bloody way possible following the second world war , when all Western eyes were focused on matters at home and , to the extent there was any foreign focus , it was on Russia . The " good guys " had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led to believe in times when communism was the fashion . <p> The communization of China took place in the usual three stages : purge , plan , and scapegoat . First there was the purge to bring about communism . There were guerillas to kill and land to nationalize . The churches had to be destroyed . The counterrevolutionaries had to be put down . The violence began in the country and spread later to the cities . All peasants were first divided into four classes that were considered politically acceptable : poor , semi poor , average , and rich . Everyone else was considered a landowner and targeted for elimination . If no landowners could be found , the " rich " were often included in this group . The demonized class was ferreted out in a country-wide series of " bitterness meetings " in which people turned in their neighbors for owning property and being politically disloyal . Those who were so deemed were immediately executed along with those who sympathized with them . <p> The rule was that there had to be at least one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be between one and five million . In addition , another four to six million landowners were slaughtered for the crime of being capital owners . If anyone was suspected of hiding wealth , he or she was tortured with hot irons to confess . The families of the killed were then tortured and the graves of their ancestors looted and pillaged . What happened to the land ? It was divided into tiny plots and distributed among the remaining peasants . <p> Then the campaign moved to the cities . The political motivations here were at the forefront , but there were also behavioral controls . Anyone who was suspected of involvement in prostitution , gambling , tax evasion , lying , fraud , opium dealing , or telling state secrets was executed as a " bandit . " Official estimates put the number of dead at two million with another two million going to prison to die . Resident committees of political loyalists watched every move . A nighttime visit to another person was immediately reported and the parties involved jailed or killed . The cells in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living in a space of about 14 inches . Some prisoners were worked to death , and anyone involved in a revolt was herded with collaborators and they were all burned . <p> There was industry in the cities , but those who owned and managed them were subjected to ever tighter restrictions : forced transparency , constant scrutiny , crippling taxes , and pressure to offer up their businesses for collectivization . There were many suicides among the small- and medium-sized business owners who saw the writing on the wall . Joining the party provided only temporary respite , since 1955 began the campaign against hidden counterrevolutionaries in the party itself . A principle here was that one in ten party members was a secret traitor . <p> As the rivers of blood rose ever higher , Mao brought about the Hundred Flowers Campaign in two months of 1957 , the legacy of which is the phrase we often hear : " Let a hundred flowers bloom . " People were encouraged to speak freely and give their point of view , an opportunity that was very tempting for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was a trick . All those who spoke out against what was happening to China were rounded up and imprisoned , perhaps between 400,000 and 700,000 people , including 10 percent of the well-educated classes . Others were branded as right wingers and subjected to interrogation , reeducation , kicked out of their homes , and shunned . <p> But this was nothing compared with phase two , which was one of historys great central planning catastrophes . Following collectivization of land , Mao decided to go further to dictate to the peasants what they would grow , how they would grow it , and where they would ship it , or whether they would grow anything at all as versus plunge into industry . This would become the Great Leap Forward that would generate historys most deadly famine . Peasants were grouped into groups of thousands and forced to share all things . All groups were to be economically self-sufficient . Production goals were raised ever higher . <p> People were moved by the hundreds of thousands from where production was high to where it was low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved too from agriculture to industry . There was a massive campaign to collect tools and transform them into industrial skill . As a means of showing hope for the future , collectives were encouraged to have huge banquets and eat everything , especially meat . This was a way of showing ones belief that the next years harvest would be even more bountiful . <p> Mao had this idea that he knew how to grow grain . He proclaimed that " seeds are happiest when growing together " and so seeds were sown at five to ten times their usual density . Plants died , the soil dried out , and the salt rose to the surface . To keep birds from eating grain , sparrows were wiped out , which vastly increased the number of parasites . Erosion and flooding became endemic . Tea plantations were turned to rice fields , on grounds that tea was decadent and capitalistic . Hydraulic equipment built to service the new collective farms did n't  work and lacked any replacement parts . This led Mao to put new emphasis on industry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agriculture , leading to ever more chaos . Workers were drafted from one sector to another , and mandatory cuts in some sectors was balanced by mandatory high quotas in another . <p> In 1957 , the disaster was everywhere . Workers were growing too weak even to harvest their meager crops , so they died watching the rice rot . Industry churned and churned but produced nothing of any use . The government responded by telling people that fat and proteins were unnecessary . But the famine couldnt be denied . The black-market price of rice rose 20 to 30 times . Because trade had been forbidden between collectives ( self-sufficiency , you know ) , millions were left to starve . By 1960 , the death rate soared from 15 percent to 68 percent , and the birth rate plummeted . Anyone caught hoarding grain was shot . Peasants found with the smallest amount were imprisoned . Fires were banned . Funerals were prohibited as wasteful . <p> Villagers who tried to flee the countryside to the city were shot at the gates . Deaths from hunger reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bark to make soup and wandered the roads looking for food . Sometimes they banded together and raided houses looking for ground maize . Women were unable to conceive because of malnutrition . People in work camps were used for food experiments that led to sickness and death . <p> How bad did it get ? In 1968 an 18-year-old member of the Red Guard , Wei Jingsheng , took refuge with a family in a village of Anhui , and here he lived to write about what he saw : <p> " We walked along beside the village Before my eyes , among the weeds , rose up one of the scenes I had been told about , one of the banquets at which the families had swapped children in order to eat them . I could see the worried faces of the families as they chewed the flesh of other peoples children . The children who were chasing butterflies in a nearby field seemed to be the reincarnation of the children devoured by their parents . I felt sorry for the children but not as sorry as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that human flesh , amidst the tears and grief of others " flesh that they would never have imagined tasting , even in their worst nightmares ? " <p> The author of this passage was jailed as a traitor but his status protected him from death and he was finally released in 1997 . <p> How many people died in the famine of 1959 " 61 ? The low range is 20 million . The high range is 43 million . Finally in 1961 , the government gave in and permitted food imports , but it was too little and too late . Some peasants were again allowed to grow crops on their own land . A few private workshops were opened . Some markets were permitted . Finally , the famine began to abate and production grew . <p> But then the third phase came : scapegoating . What had caused the calamity ? The official reason was anything but communism , anything but Mao . And so the politically motivated roundup began again , and here we get the very heart of the Culture Revolution . Thousands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ died there . In prison , the slightest excuse was used to dispense with people " all to the good , since the prisoners were a drain on the system , so far as those in charge were concerned . The largest penal system ever built was organized in a military fashion , with some camps holding as many as 50,000 people . <p> There was some sense in which everyone was in prison . Arrests were sweeping and indiscriminate . Everyone had to carry around a copy of Maos Little Red Book . To question the reason for arrest was itself evidence of disloyalty , since the state was infallible . Once arrested , the safest path was instant and frequent confession . Guards were forbidden from using overt violence , so interrogations would go on for hundreds of hours , and often the prisoner would die during this process . Those named in the confession were then hunted down and rounded up . Once you got through this process , you were sent to a labor camp , where you were graded according to how many hours you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meat nor given any sugar or oil . Labor prisoners were further controlled by the rationing of the little food they had . <p> The final phase of this incredible litany of criminality lasted from 1966 to 1976 , during which the number killed fell dramatically to " only " one to three million . The government , now tired and in the first stages of demoralization , began to lose control , first within the labor camps and then in the countryside . And it was this weakening that led to the final , and in some ways the most vicious , of the communist periods in Chinas history . <p> The first stages of rebellion occurred in the only way permissible : people began to criticize the government for being too soft and too uncommitted to the communist goal . Ironically , this began to appear precisely as moderation became more overt in Russia . Neo-revolutionaries in the Red Guard began to criticize the Chinese communists as " Khrushchev-like reformers . " As one writer put it , the guard " rose up against its own government in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the personality cult of Mao reached it height , with the Little Red Book achieving a mythic status . The Red Guards roamed the country in an attempt to purge the Four Old-Fashioned Things : ideas , culture , customs , and habits . The remaining temples were barricaded . Traditional opera was banned , with all costumes and sets in the Beijing Opera burned . Monks were expelled . The calendar was changed . All Christianity was banned . There were to be no pets such as cats and birds . Humiliation was the order of the day . <p> Thus was the Red Terror : in the capital city , there were 1,700 deaths and 84,000 people were run out . In other cities such as Shanghai , the figures were worse . A massive party purge began , with hundreds of thousands arrested and many murdered . Artists , writers , teachers , scientists , technicians : all were targets . Pogroms were visited on community after community , with Mao approving at every step as a means of eliminating every possible political rival . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it became ever more brutal and totalitarian in its outlook . <p> Finally in 1976 , Mao died . Within a few months , his closest advisers were all imprisoned . And the reform began slowly at first and then at breakneck speed . Civil liberties were restored ( comparatively ) and the rehabilitations began . Torturers were prosecuted . Economic controls were gradually relaxed . The economy , by virtue of human and private economic initiative , was transformed . <p> Having read the above , you are now in a tiny elite of people who know anything about the greatest death camp in the history of the world that China became between 1949 and 1976 , an experiment in total control unlike anything else in history . <p> Do n't  tell me that we 've learned anything from history .

Since the Euro is 60% weighted in the dollar basket , then this is what I think spikes the dollar . <p> On April 9 , 2015 at 10:54 am , Matthewsays : <p> Definitely a failed experiment , but that does n't  mean it ca n't be held together for far longer than the bears think . I agree that if the dollar spikes it wont be due to the dollar really going up but due to the euro going down . This is not just semantics , its the difference between fiction and non-fiction .

I say Jason is a side distraction and he should go and BOOB apples .. <p> I do n't disagree that debt defaults are coming but this is n't an excessive greed on Wall Street story . Capital ( both debt and equity ) flows to where it is best treated and where the highest potential returns are expected . For the last few years that appeared to be in the build-out of the shale production infrastructure . Excessive speculation in a particular industry happens during every business cycle in a capital intensive industry that gives the illusion of above average returns . Last cycle we saw this happen in real estate and the cycle before that it was in the telecommunication infrastructure . <p> Capital intensive businesses like these are characterized by supply/demand imbalances . A typical cycle starts with rising demand for a product which outpaces the existing supply . Prices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher . As prices rise , producers look to raise capital and increase capex to bring more supply online . Eventually supply rises to meet and then exceed demand causing an excess supply of that commodity . When supply ultimately exceeds demand , prices then start to fall to reflect the new supply/demand imbalance . Eventually producers will take supply offline by closing projects , shuttering capex projects or going bankrupt because they cant operate above their cost of capital . <p> To blame the banks for this is misguided in my opinion . Banks are nothing more than intermediaries that facilitate the capital raising process . They simply connect companies that are looking to raise additional capital with investors that are searching for higher returns . This paper was being sold to sophisticated institutional investors who understood the risks associated with investing in such speculative ventures . The banks have no fiduciary responsibility to these investors other than presenting the facts as they are .

Basically if you make an inflation model that is as conservative as possible , you get an answer similar to the published CPI but if you choose a simpler model then the upside to CPI should have been much greater somewhere between 3.0 and 3.5% for Feb and Mar 2017 . Even so , inflation was due to peak then because of the peak in year over year oil price changes which occurred in February , plain and simple . Inflation has peaked but it should have been at about LONG ...

The result is expected to be a low cost , low environmental footprint , but highly profitable mine . <p> A further 20,000m of drilling is budgeted and planned for this new year and we must remember that exploration drilling continues to focus on the discovery of new gold-copper resources at Hot Maden , especially to the south of the Main Zone within the old " Russian Mining Area . <p> The Joint Venture will also continue to work on the technical studies and optimisations required @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , which is anticipated to be completed during Q3 , 2017 .

Based on grades and contained metal for Au and Cu , it is assumed that both commodities have reasonable potential to be economically extractable . <p> In addition , a maiden Inferred Mineral Resource for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 2% Zn cut-off ) was reported . However , this zinc resource has not been considered in the current PEA , although future technical studies will consider the potential economics of mining this mineralised zone . <p> Mining Method and Mineral ProcessingMining of the wide , near vertical gold-copper mineralisation in the Hot Maden Main Zone is expected to be undertaken through underground mining using underhand , mechanised transverse and longitudinal long hole open stoping ( LHOS ) with engineered fill mining techniques . The Stopes are mined using an underhand extraction sequence ( Top Down ) utilising a primary/secondary stope extraction methodology to exploit the grade profile , which diminishes with depth.The Hot Maden project is divided into two main areas , North and South . The northern area consists of the wider portion of the ore body and as a result is modelled predominantly transverse LHOS to maintain the production rate . Some stopes less than 20m long and/or wide have been developed longitudinally . <p> The southern portion of the mineralisation is thinner and has been modelled in a longitudinal LHOS layout . This has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development required for access to this mineralisation . <p> Access to the north and south areas are by independent declines . The northern decline is accessed by a box cut portal whereas the southern portal is an adit into the hill . <p> The PEA reviewed 0.8 Mtpa , 1.0 Mtpa and 1.2 Mtpa production profiles at a range of NSR COGs from USD50/t to USD200/t . NSR was used instead of the gold equivalent used in the Mineral Resource to capture the full value of all mining blocks due to the relationship and variability in grade , processing recoveries , concentrate recoveries and post gate costs . The base case mining scenario was identified as 1.0 Mtpa , however , an achievable optimum economic outcome was identified at a production rate of 1.2Mtpa and NSR cut-off-grade of USD 100/ in situ tonnes ( this NSR cut-off equates to an approximate 3.3g/t AuEq cut-off grade ) . <p> A variable processing recovery , dependant on grade , has been applied in the PEA resulting in a project weighted average recovery of 88% Au and 90% Cu . The current Hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( LOM ) composites with the production of two concentrates a typical copper gold rich concentrate ( 25% Cu and 85 g/t Au ) and a gold-bearing pyrite concentrate . The flowsheet is currently being tested on Ultra High Grade ( UHG ) composites . The incorporation of a gravity concentrator has been included for gold ores in excess of 100 g/t Au . <p> Economics Summary- Throughput Analysis at cut-off NSR US$100/t <p> Mining Scenario <p> Throughput <p> Total CAPEX <p> After-tax NPVAt 8% Discount <p> After-tax IRR <p> Payback ( Incl .

It 's probably better set-up right now than at any other time in history , for a large number of reasons . I hope it can finally overwhelm , once and for all the schemers who work to keep it down . <p> I continue to think that cash elimination is the biggest story out there . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are dark and deeply disturbing . I realize that I keep coming back to this theme , but it 's because it registers with me as being so incredibly important . Sometimes , you have to say something five times before people say , " Wow . This is important . I better do something about it . " If people decide to " do something about it , " they are going to find that their options are limited . Gold being one of the few of them . Gold demand would go nuts if only the people could finally understand why they need to buy it right now . I feel a bit like Don Quixote , but I also think that the dam of realization is coming very close to breaking , and that there could be an outright flood of new , popular awareness and action . <p> So far the Xau is up 30% for the year since the low in Nov and the Hui up 33% .

Last year it would have outperformed just about anything , with a &gt;16x rise . But my observation is that these 3x funds only perform that way in a very strongly rising market .

We also touch on the the commercial short position and if he thinks it is a worthwhile indicator . 216618 @qwx1076618 <p> Mr Kaplan , thanks for clearing up an issue that several folks on this site have been using to " prove " that the gold price is/was/will be doomed . I regularly see members here spewing about bearish indicators of the COT . Some even trott out qualified technicians like Dan Norcinni to prove their bearish calls . If two or three indicators is all you needed to predict the future prices of any commodity , then everyone would be trillion airs . Thanks for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Confused I appreciate your compliment . It is important to always study the history of any alleged indicator to see if it has proven merit . Since there is zero correlation over a period of decades between a heavy commercial net short position for gold or silver and a subsequent price drop , it makes no sense to claim that it has any value . Steve <p> On June 20 , 2016 at 10:50 am , Silverdollarsays : <p> I really appreciate the way Mr. Kaplan thinks . Also like his explanations and input on commercials and their future positions . Refreshing to say the least over the standard drivel and explanations we hear on the majority of articles and commentators . Thanks for having him on your program . <p> Silverdollar I really appreciate your kind and thoughtful words .

I will be delighted to appear on this forum as long as Al and Cory will put up with me . Steve <p> On June @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The leverage that the miners offer tells us a lot about what kind of market we are in . One of the many reasons that I " know " that 2011 did not mark the secular top is that the leverage offered by the miners was miserable . <p> Example : <p> From the 2010 low to the 2011 high , silver went up 240% while AXU went up 269% for an insulting 1.2x leverage . <p> The last 6-7 months have been very different . From trough to peak , silver gained about 32% while AXU gained 557% for a true bull market leverage of 17.4x THAT is more like it . Why own risky miners at all if the potential gains are n't  substantially greater ? <p> On June 20 , 2016 at 5:10 pm , Excelsiorsays : <p> Great point Matthew . I 'm in the risky miners exactly for that kind of leverage , and we are FINALLY starting to see it here in 2016 . Fun times ! <p> Excelsior Stay invested as long as the " leverage " , actually a high ratio of outperformance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and especially below 1.5:1 , it is usually time to sell and wait for the next bull market . Steve <p> Matthew Actually most bull markets for gold and silver mining shares will feature high ratios of gains relative to gold bullion in their early stages , and very low ratios in their late stages . This is especially useful since it gives you helpful buy and sell signals . Prior to Friday , GDXJ had gained 7.5% for every 1% rise in the gold price from their respective bottoms of January 20 , 2016 ( 1067 gold , 16.87 GDXJ ) . On Friday , the ratios were near 1:1 , indicating short-term weakness for gold which will likely happen as gold and silver mining shares keep recovering from early selloffs . At some point , perhaps in 2017 , the ratio will contract to 2:1 or less , signaling that an exit strategy has become appropriate . Steve

This book talks about Fragile organisms that seek to centralize power , avoid chaos , unpredictability , and failures . However , when the failures do occur they are generally more catastrophic ( black swan ) because they never develop an ability to deal with them . Pres Obama is an example of a " fragile " leadercentralized control , take minimal action in order to keep everything as calm as possible , it is better not to act than to act and make a mistake , etc . His legacy is also fragile and the " black swan " of a trump presidency will be catastrophic to its long-term existence . The Policies Obama put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people , they were forced on them through a centralization of power that makes it necessary to maintain that power in order to keep the legacy alive .

The election fractured the progressive power structure and put Obamas entire legacy at risk . That is why he is coming back to Washington to lead the " shadow govt " and try to salvage as much as he can . Pres Trump on the other hand is the opposite of fragile , he is " Antifragile " . He thrives on conflict and " chaos " and is actually stronger because of them .

As long as he can survive in Washington , the attacks against him only give him more exposure and ultimately make him stronger . Rather than sulk around the White House and only emerge to give the American people a condescending lecture as Obama did , Pres Trump is engaging DIRECTLY with the people that elected him . I expect he will continue to change the standard by which the POTUS communicates with the public . If that means he leads a 2+ hour press conference , or rally in Florida , it does n't  really matter as long as he is communicating directly , surviving the attacks , and continuing to feed off the negative attention the establishment sends his way.like the first truly " Antifragile " POTUS I think he has the potential to prove he is , he will emerge from this still immensely unpopular with some groups , immensely more popular with others , and in the process could potentially incite the change this country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for every one that is chopped off , an Antifragile POTUS has the potential to turn turmoil , chaos , buffetings , and conflict into an overall positive outcome for the country .

Steve <p> Matthew Actually most bull markets for gold and silver mining shares will feature high ratios of gains relative to gold bullion in their early stages , and very low ratios in their late stages . This is especially useful since it gives you helpful buy and sell signals . Prior to Friday , GDXJ had gained 7.5% for every 1% rise in the gold price from their respective bottoms of January 20 , 2016 ( 1067 gold , 16.87 GDXJ ) . On Friday , the ratios were near 1:1 , indicating short-term weakness for gold which will likely happen as gold and silver mining shares keep recovering from early selloffs . At some point , perhaps in 2017 , the ratio will contract to 2:1 or less , signaling that an exit strategy has become appropriate . Steve

Third , the Fed gave us exactly what we wanted to hear , and , yet , the market sold off the following day . <p> Oil <p> But it did not stop pundits from trying to provide reasons for Thursdays market decline , even though they were really scratching their heads . The first reason I heard was the market drop was because of oils rise . ( Forget that the fact that the market is still higher than when oil began this current rise . ) The reasoning states that the higher cost of oil hurts consumer demand . I guess none of these folks bothered to look at the manner in which oil and the markets rallied strongly together from 2009-2011 or from 2012-2014 . Oh , wait . During that period of time it was good that they were rallying together because the higher demand for oil meant that the economy was doing well . But I guess oil is now rallying because the economy is not doing well and that is why the market is going down ? Huh ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Apple <p> The next " reason " I heard from a popular television pundit was that the market dropped because AAPL dropped . So , I guess the 40%-plus drop in Apple while the market rallied 20% two years ago should be ignored since they were really not tied together at that time , but now they are . Right ? If one is really honest about it , you would recognize that even though it may " look " right from a very superficial perspective , it is logically flawed to assume this short-term seeming correlation should be read as the causation for the markets decline . Yet , it never stops pundits from spouting off about some of the most nonsensical seeming correlations , and invent a story to fit their perspective . What amazes me is that so many believe this type of fantasy just because there is some superficial seeming correlation in price action . <p> Reality <p> The plain and simple reason is that the market had several setups to break out over the last two weeks , and when they all failed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that was down . Sentiment was simply not strong enough this past week to power the markets through resistance , and this is exactly what I warned about last week . I noted that if the market was truly in a 3rd wave breakout mode , then it should have broken out early in the week . But it failed to follow through on its setups , so we had to turn more cautious in the middle of the week , as we ran the risk of another pullback before the next rally phase takes hold toward 2200 . <p> Right now , those that have been bearish for the last 300-plus points up in the market think their time has finally come . Yes , the bears are now sharpening their claws , thinking their 20% correction feast is upon us . I am sorry to disappoint them , but nothing is suggesting that to me at this time . While it is certainly possible that I am wrong in my perspective , as we all know , no one can always be right when dealing with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major levels of real support yet . Since I have an unfinished pattern which still needs several waves higher to take us over 2200 to complete before we see that 20%-plus correction , I am going to give the benefit of the doubt to the bull market and let it break some levels of support before I am able to switch perspectives . <p> Moreover , for all those who believe in the infallibility of the old " sell in May " adage , I have a fractal to present to you . This comparative fractal analysis was brought to my attention by Garrett Patten , the lead analyst for our World Markets service at Elliottwavetrader.net . His fractal analysis presents us with a picture of how the 2015 market pattern is an almost exact copy of the picture from 2014 . <p> In fact , if you look closely , you will see a very similar pattern taking shape as we enter May 2015 , relative to what we experienced in 2014 . In 2014 , if you had bought the low in early May rather than selling , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fall . This is quite similar to what I am expecting this year in the S&amp;P 500 , with even greater potential gains to be seen in the Russell Index . <p> As for the Elliott Wave pattern I see , I still have a question as to whether the low was in at the bottom we struck on Thursday , as it really looks incomplete to me . I am still going to be watching for further weakness next week , which would play out as " flat " for wave ( 2 ) in the SPX . <p> My next turn date is May 4 ( which can mark a high ) , with the one following on May 11 , being a very strong turn date . This leads me to believe that we can still see a c-wave down into the end of next week , which would not only rhyme well with the strong turn date providing us with a bottom , but it would rhyme almost perfectly with the 2014 fractal analysis presented by Garrett . <p> However , all that being said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week . As I have noted many times , I am going to maintain the hedges on my long positions until I see the first 5 wave structure up off the lows , followed by a corrective 3 wave pullback , and then a take out of the high of the first 5 wave structure . That will be my initial signal that the 3rd wave breakout is underway . For the last several weeks , we have not yet seen this signal . So , I will remain cautious in my positioning until that signal is seen , since risk management is what maintains longer-term profitability . <p> I am still of the opinion that the market will be taking us to the 2200 region , and potentially beyond , before we see that 20%-plus correction . However , we may still see some more weakness before that rally begins . With the uncanny fractal similarities between 2014 and 2015 , I believe that May will be a buying opportunity in a similar manner to which it was in 2014. 216618 @qwx1076618 <p> Avi : In prior commentary you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an indicator of the markets direction .

Thank you Cory and Al <p> On May 5 , 2015 at 11:13 am , Garysays : <p> I would suggest it may be a little later . Buy in June or July . <p> This market needs an intermediate degree correction before its likely to make any big sustained moves higher . Were getting a smaller daily cycle correction this week . The larger intermediate degree correction wont be due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's why I say buy in June or July . <p> On May 5 , 2015 at 2:30 pm , Shadsays : <p> I agree Gary . There will still be some selling in May and people going away , and this will continue into the summer doldrums . It never fails that every year some analyst decides to be the " contrarian " that says people wont sell in May this year . The problem with the cliche is that it stuck for a reason , and people cant get this out of the back of their minds , so they lighten up on their positions " just in case " . It becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy . <p> The market correction that is upon us should just be a 2-4% correction for now , and then in the summer people will enter new positions and ride the markets to new allt time highs in the Fall . My concern for the 20% correction is still focused for Sept/Oct , but , I 'll be keeping an eye on the severity of the pullback we get in the general markets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is ahead of schedule = <p> On May 5 , 2015 at 2:35 pm , Shadsays : <p> I do agree with Avi that it would be more telling to have the S&amp;P over 2200 before we get the bigger 20% correction . That level will likely be taken out in August/Sept . <p> On May 5 , 2015 at 10:13 pm , Shadsays : <p> Having said that about this " Seasonality factor " nobody should base their investment thesis on any ( 1 ) factor ie.seasonality , or the Fed , ECB , BOJ and the central banker cartel , or fundamentals and the news feed , or technical analysis ( pick your system ) , or sentiment indicators , or political events They all should be taken into account . <p> The last 2 year years which were both up in May for the S&amp;P is also not proof that things will be the same this year . The market is far more skittish at its current lofty levels than in 2013 or 2014 , and the US economic data has been coming in weak . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the S&amp;P down further and people will still consider the cute little rhyme in the back of their minds . <p> Lastly , many larger investors only hold equities for a portion of the year and skip the summer months STARTING in May , and they 're out for June , July , and even August . Everyone piles back in right before or after Labor Day in September as the ritual goes . So just tracking the May ( with an average change of .11% for the month for the last 65 years ) does not take the May/June/July overall trend into account . <p> Personally , I trade all year long and do n't totally buy into all the seasonality plays , but the market is made up of many people . If the majority of traders buy into something and there is a probability that over 3-4 months ( May-Aug ) that things trend down or just stagnate in the summer doldrums , then I do n't  discount it either . <p> Seasonality in a company ( a retail store ) , in a sector ( home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ markets it is worth considering when mapping out how things may develop . Looking at only May just misses the point and is not a thorough review of the summer doldrums which are May Aug . <p> Something tells me they wont be doldrums this year because there are so many things coming to a head with the US dollar , the Euro , Canadian Loonie , weaker economic data , the Fed rate-hike ongoing discussion , Oil is doing a counter-trend bounce but will reverse soon , and commodities will be putting in their major bottom . <p> Lots of fireworks to come I 'm sure . <p> On May 6 , 2015 at 7:09 am , Shadsays : <p> One final thought is that when investors do pile back into stocks in Aug/Sept it should take the S&amp;P over 2200 at that time and this is where I 'd anticipate the big 20% correction . <p> On May 5 , 2015 at 1:34 pm , MBKsays : <p> According to my updates , Avi is open to the possibility that IWM could drop to around 118-119 in the next few days before strongly rebounding towards 130+.

@@120400420 @9400420/ <h> Industry Reports Thu 15 Dec , 2016 <h> A check in on Chinese Gold demand <p> I found this article to be very interesting . It outlines the ongoing trend of Chinese gold buyers stepping in when prices drop to bargain hunt and purchase . This helps provide somewhat of a floor to falling gold prices . What the post outlines is that the Chinese buying narrative is not picking up due to a couple reasons . Have a read , its not along article but does provide some valuable insights . <p> More recently , this pattern led to the 7-fold gains of 2001-2011 . It then shifted the untold mountain of gold which went East over the 5 years that followed . It also explains why gold did n't  surge higher when India and China buyers jumped on the 2013 crash . <p> Yes , China and India between them account for one ounce in every two sold to end-users each year . And yes , they bought record quantities of metal as prices fell 25% in 2013 . <p> But while Western money managers like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consumers tend to act smarter , building their holdings fastest when the metal looks cheap , ready to ease off or take profits when prices jump . <p> Fast forward to 2016 , and Chinese and Indian imports both fell hard in the first half of this year , with metal flowing instead into London vaults " centre of the worlds wholesale market , and home ( alongside Switzerland ) to the largest private investing hoards . <p> Since July , gold prices have more than halved their prior gains for the year as professional investing has reversed course . That retreat in prices has also seen demand from golds Big Two turn higher yet again . But here on the cusp of 2017 , Western investors relying on China and India to stem the current post-Trump dump might need to take care . <p> " After a sustained fall in any asset , " explains strategist Tom Kendall at Chinese-owned bullion and commodities giant ICBC Standard Bank explains , " there is a risk of turning bearish just as the market finds a floor . <p> " The problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that floor is created has largely seized up . Because intervention by policymakers in both India and China has disrupted , at least temporarily , the markets natural reaction function . " <p> Intervention hardly describes New Delhis nuclear attack on Indias entire economy . As you may know , it has caused a cash-crunch across India " the number 2 gold investing and jewelry consumer " by cancelling 85% of its currency in circulation . The aim is to kill the black-market economy . It has badly wounded if not shot dead the legal gold industry in the cross fire . <p> Formerly pro-gold Beijing is meantime restricting new import licences for gold into China , hoping to stem the outflow of money starting to drag on ( and also inspired by ) the falling Yuan currency . <p> Typically , this would signal strong demand in the No.1 consumer market , and that would eventually feed back into stronger global prices according to this close analysis by Neil Meader at specialists Metals Focus . Because Western traders and fund managers would take stronger Chinese demand as a bullish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ massive premiums of 2013 however , this end-2016 Shanghai premium is a supply-driven thing . Yes , demand appears to have turned higher on Novembers drop , with retails sales of kilobars in Hong Kong making the Wall Street Journals pages as a useful proxy . But Novembers raw delivery data for metal taken out of the Shanghai Gold Exchanges warehouses ( Chinas only legal route into private circulation ) showed just a 6% pop from the same month last year , and only after lagging 2015 throughout . <p> Year-to-date , those SGE withdrawals stand 25% lower from 2015s record . That reflects the typical bargain-hunting response of shying away when gold prices rise . But now it is blocked from taking advantage as prices retreat . Indeed , per Meaders analysis , this months news about Chinas Communist government turning against gold could invite more bearish bets by Western hedge funds . Because while the myth of " gold to da moon ! " because of Chinese demand proved truly mythic over the last 5 years ( see how the gold market works , above ) , Beijing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gold in the same way the Peoples Bank has diversified some of its giant foreign-exchange reserves too . <p> Beijings switch from gold-promoting to gold-restricting is n't getting anything like the coverage it warrants , least of all on the bug-o-sphere which trumpeted the one-party states pro-gold adverts and editorials so hard . But maybe Indias experience is finally looking too close for comfort to the politburo . Because " gold risks denting Chinas trade surplus " a key plank of its economic-growth model , " as we noted 5 years ago , when Chinas gold imports overtook its world-leading domestic mine output . Back then it did n't  matter , thanks to Chinas broader export-led boom . But it might now .

We believe Pretium could receive project financing and environmental permitting by the end of first-quarter 2015 and break ground on construction of Brucejack in British Columbia by the end of second-quarter 2015 . We believe PolyMet could also receive environmental permitting , arrange financing and begin construction during 2015 , but most likely not until the back half of the year . <p> Of the uranium companies we cover , we believe Buy-rated UR-Energy ( - URG- ) is best positioned to take advantage of improving uranium prices .

Additionally , Synergy Resources is poised for significant production growth in 2015 , despite the lower oil price and has the balance-sheet flexibility to take advantage if accretive assets become available , in our opinion . <p> We believe zinc is poised for a strong 2015 with a potential shortage in late 2015 or early 2016 following the closure of the Century mine in Australia . We believe copper prices will improve somewhat over 2015 , but we anticipate continued volatility and believe the copper price is bound below $3.25 per pound until demand recovers .

We also touch on the Bullish Gold Miners percentage chart- and our opinion if the bottom for gold is in ( since there have been a lot of recent headlines on this topic ) . <p> Here is Pauls exact comment <p> Cory and Doc , I think you are far too bearish . You need to throw away your USD charts once in awhile and look at the elephant in the room . The US is important but it is not the world economy and constantly talking about the USD price of gold is leading you astray . <p> If the USD went up 2% against all other currencies , and gold went up 1% against all other currencies , would you say that gold was going up or down ? It is going up , of course , but you keep saying it is going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ currencies bottomed over a week ago . Look at gold in Euros , Yen or Yuan . Gold is getting a buy.a strong buy . If India starts buying again ( as they should ) , it will only go higher . <p> When it comes to the stocks , the Bullish Gold Miners percentage is telling you everything you needed to know . The bottom was a week ago . Rarely does it get so low as it did then . When it does this , it is almost always a great time to buy . 216618 @qwx1076618 <p> Uh oh , Doc and Core getting schooled ! ?

The accepted position is the the price of gold and silver are set on the COMEX by paper gold or paper silver . This may be true for temporary , relatively short time periods . I , however , believe that increasingly the price is being set in Asia , not the US , and while the apparent prices of gold and silver may fluctuate as the dollar exchange rate fluctuates , if the price of gold or silver in the US or on the LBMA drop too too much relative to China the amount of arbitrage is so great that the price in th US is forced to rise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NO LONGER BEING SET IN THE US or London .

We believe Pretium could receive project financing and environmental permitting by the end of first-quarter 2015 and break ground on construction of Brucejack in British Columbia by the end of second-quarter 2015 . We believe PolyMet could also receive environmental permitting , arrange financing and begin construction during 2015 , but most likely not until the back half of the year . <p> Of the uranium companies we cover , we believe Buy-rated UR-Energy ( - URG- ) is best positioned to take advantage of improving uranium prices . UR-Energy 's combination of low-cost production and underutilized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profitability during 2015 . <p> We view Buy-rated Synergy Resources ( - SYRG- ) as a unique exploration and production company due to its focus on low-cost production and return on investment . We believe these advantages position Synergy Resources to weather a low-oil-price environment better than its peers . Additionally , Synergy Resources is poised for significant production growth in 2015 , despite the lower oil price and has the balance-sheet flexibility to take advantage if accretive assets become available , in our opinion . <p> We believe zinc is poised for a strong 2015 with a potential shortage in late 2015 or early 2016 following the closure of the Century mine in Australia . We believe copper prices will improve somewhat over 2015 , but we anticipate continued volatility and believe the copper price is bound below $3.25 per pound until demand recovers .

Not I. <p> We can see the supply/demand picture quicker in oil than gold/silever since there is no above ground supply . Regardless what , the current price is too low since most countries can not fund their social program with this level of oil price . Stakeholders have to cut price otherwise they face serious problem even revolution . <p> On December 4 , 2014 at 10:54 am , Lawrencesays : <p> I mean cut production <p> On December 4 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the energy focus , I would like this to continue with extra time spent on energy Al , thanks ! <p> I mentioned this to Al yesterday , fundimentals is no more than supply and demand , I mentioned oil specifically , we produce more oil than we use so the price drops . Neat to talk about who is or is not producing and why , but the only thing that really matters is how much is produced and how much is used . <p> When we keep our eye on those two " considerations " we are much more likely to invest correctly . At least that how I 've found investing , other than the odd aberration , but eventually prices should go to where they should logically be . <p> That 's the issue with figuring out gold , we have no idea the supply available , the only thing we really know is all demand is repeatedly and continuously met , the run to 1800+ could have been an aberration . <p> I have to partially disagree because investing in precious metals is , more often than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companies has many more considerations than just the supply/demand scenario that would apply to major producers . <p> Whew , I guess I have learned at least a little bit over the past 30 or 40 years ! <p> On December 4 , 2014 at 1:07 pm , Ronald Forstnersays : <p> Al , I have over the years off and on caught one of your commentaries on precious metals . Several years ago , when I began to follow precious metals , your voice was always a reasoned one .

Thanks , Ron <p> John Embry of Sprott Asset Management : Investors are doing the right thing by attempting to buy physical gold and silver at these depressed price levels . But it 's absolutely critical that the dealer with whom people are placing orders can guarantee you almost immediate delivery . <p> I think the gold and silver paper market is one of the greatwar Ponzi schemes on earth . So if you are going to buy physical , make sure the entity you are buying it from has it immediately available for shipment . If they are telling it 's going to be many weeks or months , I would run the other way because there is absolutely no excuse for that . <p> I just found this funny , he states there is no excuse for waiting on metel , is that par chance due to there is available all a person could want to purchase ? <p> I 've read the " warnings " of coming price drops , my guess is they are right , prices should drop , but not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just simple supply and demand , more supply than demand . <p> On December 4 , 2014 at 4:36 pm , bjsays : <p> If young people are n't  driving so much , its because they cant afford the cars because they do n't  have jobs , and in turn do n't  need to get up everyday and drive to work and back .

In CAD , EUR , JPY or GBP , it 's been a different ( and better ) story . <p> As a reminder , and within quoting him exactly , Avi Gilburt has discussed a few weeks ago of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strengthening USD something about which , IMHO , he has not been asked to elaborate a bit more " but that is potentially an extremely valuable perspective . <p> GL investing/trading to all . <p> LPG <p> On December 30 , 2014 at 1:43 pm , Lawrencesays : <p> Mostly agree . I do n't  think Chinese Yuan overtakes US $ as THE world reserve currency . It is against the culture to spend more than they produce , which is required by a world reserve currency status . What China want is to restore its status as the dominant power in the East Asia . If you take a look at the history , China dominated that region for most of the last 18 out of the 20 centuries and handed over to the West after 1900 . The idea from Confucius theory is a Grand Unified nation . So Chinese map most include areas enclosed by natural barriers . The purpose is to avoid constant infighting . <p> The purpose of the new currency blocks is two fold . First it allows China continue to trade in case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from sabotage China . Contrary to most peoples belief , US is not a peace lover . It actually actively damages other countries financially and militarily to keep them weak . Eventually I see US dollar greatly weakened and Yuan , Yen , euro and Ruble run parallel with US dollar . China will also keep US treasury for a long time to assure mutual destruction . <p> As for FED printing dollar to keep US military strong , I has my reservation since this will result in great dilution of peoples purchasing power to make US more like Germany in WWII . All hyper inflation is resulted from printing money , 100% . <p> On December 30 , 2014 at 1:46 pm , Lawrencesays : <p> I think the long term goal of China is the manufacture center of the world . <p> On December 30 , 2014 at 2:03 pm , Birdmansays : <p> What ?

Since the leaders in Chinese top circle are mostly engineers so it is their game . They do buy a lot from rest of the world but corruption is preventing them from doing more . <p> On December 30 , 2014 at 2:23 pm , Lawrencesays : <p> An extension of manufacture center idea is to bid large engineering projects around the world .

Who knows what will happen . <p> On December 30 , 2014 at 1:54 pm , LPGsays : <p> Interesting Lawrence . <p> As Kyle Bass rightly noted , for a country to have its currency get the status or world reserve currency , the country must have a deep ( sovereign ) bond market AND rule of law . So far , it therefore seems difficult China can achieve this granted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rule of law might be the most serious impediment . <p> Diversifying away from the USD for China also achieves this though : diversification hence RISK diversification . <p> Best to all , and GL investing . <p> LPG <p> On December 30 , 2014 at 2:03 pm , Lawrencesays : <p> I think this is one part . It is very difficult for China to evolve to the state of the west , both people and politicians do n't  believe it is realistic for China . The other part is that financial industry has to be dominating as part of economy if China becomes the world reserve currency . I can not imaging merchants become the only game in town since their status has been under prostitution for the last 20 centuries . People do n't  trust merchants and believe they are cheaters . It has improved a lot but Chinese do n't  view merchants same way as the West . <p> On December 30 , 2014 at 2:57 pm , Dick Tracysays : <p> China will not have an edge anymore with cheap labor , manufacturers are building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ species , this revolution in artificial intelligence is part of the problem we are seeing with the imbalances in the world economy and it is a lot more complete then people realize .

China was trying to award @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 90s and they concluded that it is not humanly doable after the survey . China also has the fastest computer in the world . I think all of these is based on the growing strength of engineering education where they turn out 5 million graduates each year . Have you heard that there are several restaurants in China using robots as waiters ? I believe the danger for China is political not technical for any future growth . <p> On December 30 , 2014 at 3:21 pm , Dick Tracysays : <p> Lawrence , if I walk around my house most of what I see that had been made in the US has been replaced by Chinese manufacturers a long time ago so I do n't  think that China is low tech , if they were to build a modern economy today using cheap labor they would n't have a market .

Busch via Email Chief Market Intelligence Officer James McDonald Director Enforcement Division Commodity Futures Trading Commission 1155 21st Street NW Washington , DC 20581 Dear Sirs , Congratulations and best wishes on your appointments to key positions at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm writing concerning a matter that the Commission has considered on a number of past occasions " allegations of a silver price manipulation on the Commodity Exchange , Inc . ( COMEX ) . The reason the Commission has considered the issue of a silver price manipulation several times in the past is because the agency 's own public data and guidelines point strongly to such a manipulation . Never have the data been more convincing than what was just published Friday , in the Commission 's release of its weekly Commitments of Traders ( COT ) Report , for positions held as of April 4 , 2017 . That report indicates that the concentrated net short position held by the four largest traders in COMEX silver futures hit an all-time extreme in numbers of contracts of 78,021 , the equivalent of 390 million oz. of silver . The concentrated net short position of the eight largest traders was indicated at 104,978 contracts or the equivalent of nearly 525 million oz. , or more than 60% of world annual mine production . No other commodity comes close to COMEX silver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compared to real world production . On its face , the large concentrated short position in COMEX silver futures would appear to be an artificial price depressant . As you know , the Commission monitors and publishes concentration data in all regulated futures markets as the prime front line defense against price manipulation . After all , it would be nearly impossible to manipulate any market without a concentrated position . But not only do COMEX silver futures stand out as having the largest concentrated short position of any commodity , in terms relative to real world production , consumption and existing inventories , the concentrated short position in COMEX silver futures is notable for other reasons . For one reason , the big short traders do not appear to be engaged in any sort of legitimate hedging , since there are no signs they represent actual producers or hedgers of physical holdings . Separate agency data , contained in the monthly Bank Participation Report , indicate that the largest shorts are mostly domestic and foreign banks essentially operating as speculators , in a pseudo-market making capacity against other speculators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activity and few , if any have disclosed any hedging in silver . The big short sellers in COMEX silver futures are financial firms , mostly banks , speculating against other big speculators and have no legitimate economic or hedging purpose in dealing in COMEX silver in the first place . As I 'm sure you know , Congress allows futures trading for the purpose of encouraging legitimate hedging , not to encourage excessive speculation . The largest COMEX silver short seller for the past nine years is JPMorgan . That has been the case ever since it acquired the failing investment bank Bear Stearns , the former largest COMEX silver short seller , according to Commission data and its correspondence with lawmakers . The special manipulative twist here is that since 2011 , JPMorgan has engaged in an epic accumulation of physical silver at prices much lower than would have existed if the bank had not also been the largest silver short seller on the COMEX . In the recently completed COMEX March silver futures delivery period , JPMorgan stopped ( accepted ) 2689 contracts in its own proprietary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a client(s) , considerably more than the 1500 contracts allowed according to exchange regulations . This while JPMorgan was the largest short holder in COMEX silver futures . It is not possible to imagine a more compelling motive or intent for manipulation than to acquire a massive amount of any commodity at depressed prices , where the acquirer is responsible for the depressed prices . Almost without fail , on every past occasion where the concentrated short position in COMEX silver futures reached extreme levels , it was only a matter of time before the price of silver gets rigged lower by these big shorts to induce speculative selling from traders operating on technical price signals . In fact , COT report data indicate that JPMorgan has never taken a loss , only profits on every silver short position it has added over the past nine years . Such results would not be possible in a market that was n't manipulated in price . In essence , speculators have taken over the price discovery process in silver because there are so few real hedgers trading on the COMEX , only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the current extreme concentrated short position leads yet again to a sharp selloff in silver , there is another issue that goes to the core of regulatory concern . In addition to the clear agency data pointing to a silver price manipulation , the presence of such a large and non-economic short position necessarily enhances the likelihood of disorderly market conditions once it becomes clear to enough market participants that unbacked concentrated short positions on the COMEX have been the reason why silver prices are so depressed . I have communicated all this to the Commission , JPMorgan and the CME Group ( owner-operator of the COMEX ) for many years , with hardly any acknowledgement or rebuttal . I am hoping you will consider this matter differently and act to finally end the manipulation . I 'm sure how you handle this matter will define your tenure . If I can be of any further assistance , please do not hesitate to call on me .

That 's the question many experts are asking themselves after American cruise missiles struck a Syrian airbase last week .

Maybe that is their final goal ? <p> On May 25 , 2017 at 6:55 am , silverbug davesays : <p> Fed balance sheet up so much and the money multiplier down so much since 2009 I meant ! <p> On May 25 , 2017 at 8:57 am , Matthewsays : <p> Yet , for some reason , the deflationists do n't  learn .

Warnings of SS and pensions collapsing have been good reading since the late 90s . For years things could n't get any worse , yet they continue to muddle along and actually get worse . The thing all analysts are missing is the tipping point , if there is one . When will we sit down to our table of consequences ? That 's really all that matters since trends can latterly go on for generations , as many of them have . Buying TLT is about as exciting as watching oil based paint dry . And it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ever does ? A concern more timely might be trying to figure out which civilizations will be on the receiving end of the $340 billion of weaponry that Trump OKed for the Saudis . <p> On May 23 , 2017 at 9:56 am , FundamentalAnalysissays : <p> I think the difference this time is that we are now effectively at zero interest rates . So pension schemes are either bidding up the bonds higher and higher to ensure their assets outweight the liabilities , alternatively they are also doing the same in the wider stock market with the blue chip stocks causing a divergence from the fundamentals of the business . Hence you have divi stocks with p/e of 30,40,50 in many cases . The tipping point is when either the pension schemes have to pay out , causing an unwinding of the assets , or if the company have to top up the schemes decreasing profits and /or decreasing the share prices or worse the dividend yields . Basically there will be a limit . However if the underlying companies can get away borrowing at near zero rates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ till the day it does n't  . We know there is a breaking point.but cant figure out when . The longer this continues , the more distorted and dangerous the end result becomes.we could see catastophic losses during the unwinding as all schemes race to unwind first to front run the other <p> I cant imagine why any Libyan might hold an irrational hatred for the West and vent it in a misguided fashion . <p> Whatever is going on , I 'm sure no soul-searching on our part is called for .

To fight terrorism , we need to stop creating terrorists . If there are 65 million refugees in the world and only one in 10,000 turns to terror , it means there are 6,499 more suicide bombers out there . That 's a lot of terror . <p> While I do n't  agree with the terrorists , I do understand why they are so pissed . <p> On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> What I do not understand is the logic and morality of terrorists that seems to imply it is reasonable to kill innocent people that have nothing to do with your reason to become a terrorist .

One wonders why no prominent war mongers with a say in policy-making are ever targeted . And a follow-on wonder , what portion of these attacks are false flags targeting peons in order to get mass support for the warmongers policies ? A non-zero figure , I think it is safe to say . <p> The difference I have with you is that I believe we need to focus on the root of the problem , and that root is not the muslim terrorists . I also think most of the things you say about the Scum terrorist attacks and Imams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opposite direction . In terms of magnitude there is no comparison between the terror the Christian West has directed toward the Muslim world , and vice versa . <p> On May 24 , 2017 at 4:07 am , Robert Moriartysays : <p> CFS : <p> You have to be kidding . Right ? <p> The purpose of terrorism is to terrorize . <p> Why would you attack armed police or the military when you can target children ? We have 22 people killed on an average weekend in Iraq and no one cares but one 8 year old is killed in England and everyone is aghast . <p> I feel sad that even a 23 year old feels it is worth dying to make a statement . And the response from the idiot politicians is to claim that the bomber was a coward . How stupid can you get ? It takes a lot of courage to blow yourself up . <p> The attack on Libya was a war crime by every measure . The US , Israel , the UK and France deposed the most responsible leader in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hole of crime and corruption .

Especially when one of those charts is ahead of the other ( also known as leading ) . The post below from Market Anthropology presents the similarities between treasuries ( TLT ) and the US dollar . <p> The charts speak for themselves but let us know what you guys think . Are we in for a significant drop in the dollar ? <h> The $s April Showers Can Bring May Flowers to Gold <p> Regardless of how hawkish the Fed frames possible future rate hikes this year , we suspect a cyclical breakdown in the US dollar index to unfold . Moreover , by our estimates of the leading market breakdown in US Treasuries last November , the window for a dollar break appears to be now open and extended through April . <p> Similar to the failed breakout in long-term Treasuries last summer that subsequently resulted in the severe correction in bonds , the dollar index has followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with last November 's upside breakout 100 . Should the index break below current levels , long-term trendline support will be tested directly below 98.50 and likely fail . <p> *Click to enlarge images* <p> As we 've noted over the years , the relationship between Treasuries and the dollar is highly dynamic , and at times " quite muddled " depending upon the time frame and markets you look at . Granted , this is true for all markets , yet even more so with Treasuries , in part due to the range of durations and also when intermarket correlations are interpreted through yields that inherently behave inverse to their corresponding bond . Simply put " it 's complicated to read and even more confusing to describe . <p> That said , from a macro perspective we have viewed the dollar following cyclical trends in long-term yields by several years , while over the intermediate term the dollar has followed more structural pivots in Treasuries by several months . <p> Shorter-term " and as frequently seen in most intermarket relationships , correlations fluctuate between the positive and negative poles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhibiting an inverse correlation extreme coming into January " the last of which was present during the previous cyclical top in the dollar in the first half of 2002 . Consequently , when Treasuries broke down from the failed breakout last November , the dollar broke out . Since then , however , the dollar fell short of making new highs this month as long-term Treasuries recently made new lows . <p> Our interpretation is that the dollar is set to follow Treasuries breakdown lead with the last lagged pivot ( 5-6 months ) of the cycle , which should mark a pattern break as the dollar turns cyclically lower without a corresponding leading move lower in Treasuries . As we described in previous notes , while we would n't be surprised to see a final leg lower in Treasuries manifest along the lines of the 1987 breakdown to complete the move , over the longer-term we like them from a relative performance perspective to equities .

To play any pull back in the US markets Doc and I prefer to play one of the VIX derivatives however as the post below states it is not a long term hold . <p> Take a read of the post from The Street and let us know how you feel about a potential pop in the VIX and how you like to play it . <p> Volatility spiked back in August of 2015 and experienced an echo-boom in January of this year . <p> Late October-early November volatility lows , as measured by the CBOE Volatility Index(VIX.X) , are associated with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An upcoming pull-back could be more methodical and less pronounced . We are experiencing technical resistance , a broadening , with lower S&amp;P 500 highs . Furthermore , its been 11 months since the S&amp;P 500 reached its all-time high . Our upward trend channel from the February lows is waning and flattening out . <p> This combined with how coupled the stock market has been with WTI Crude Oil prices suggests that any move down in oil prices could be less than beneficial for U.S. Markets . Furthermore , an oil dip after DOHA could hurt your portfolios performance . <p> " CBOE Volatility Index- 13.62 declined 1.74 for the week and once again back near the lows made between late October and early November last year when SPX was trending higher . Based on real-time prices of options on the S&amp;P 500 Index , VIX reflects investors consensus view of future ( 30-day ) expected stock market volatility . <p> " While day-to-day VIX changes offer little forecasting insight following the VIX Futures premium helps since it measures expectations of tactical professional traders and money managers using VIX @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Premiums for normal term structures during uptrends are 10% to 20% while premiums above 20% are unsustainable suggesting expectations that the VIX will soon return to higher levels associated with pullbacks . Alternatively , premiums less than 10% suggest caution and negative premiums indicate oversold conditions . The volume weighted premium was in the normal range last week , ending Friday at 17.25% " <p> What should you do to protect yourself and your portfolio ? <p> The purest play is to buy the May or June VIX futures or in the money VIX calls . Some people do not have futures or options trading capabilities , so they could buy ( VXX ) . Of course , the VXX is a terrible position to hold long term because its designed to lose 99% of its money over time . The only investment worse than VXX is ( UVXY ) or ( TVIX ) , which are VXX levered times two . <p> Trading volatility or hedging through volatility derivatives can be complicated , but it does n't  have to be . You can always sell some of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sidelines . If you want to bet that the S&amp;P 500 will pullback , you can buy ( SH ) , that 's inverse S&amp;P 500 . <p> I do not have any major holdings right now . I 'm mostly in cash and am waiting patiently for this pullback so I can reinitiate my favorite long positions , ( ZIV ) , ( XIV ) and ( SVXY ) . These exchange traded notes are some of the best ways to gain long stock market exposure without having to invest as much of your cash . Meanwhile , I 'm going to hold onto my Jan. 19 , 2018 SVXY 20 calls . <p> From a technical perspective , the S&amp;P 500 is approaching significant levels of resistance and making lower and lower highs since May 2016 . In addition to this , the S&amp;P 500 outlook remains weak due to lower crude oil prices on the recent DOHA meeting failure and the S&amp;P 500s high correlation with crude prices . The current uptrend is waning and hedging your positions near S&amp;P 500 recent highs can help you reduce risk . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time of publication , the author held positions in the January 19 , 2018 20 calls- mentioned . 216618 @qwx1076618 <p> Debt , money printing , negative rates , elimination of paper money .

Thanks for what you do ! <p> On January 30 , 2016 at 7:27 am , Briansays : <p> The interview with Joe Mazumdar was excellent . There were several insights about selecting mid-tiers that I had never heard before . <p> His mentioning of Claude and Lake Shore Gold as examples of mid-tiers gold producers , also gave me a little more confidence in the Canadian PM miners I have selected to invest in ( Claude , Lakeshore Gold , Richmont , Kirkland Lake ) <p> With a $136M market cap and just one mine , I cant call Claude a mid-tier miner . Its still very much a junior and that is a good thing . <p> On January 30 , 2016 at 5:19 pm , Excelsiorsays : <p> Claude is growing from a small producer into a mid tier and actually have 2 different mines ( Seabee &amp; the Santoy mine ) . Then the Santoy Mine complex has 2 key deposits the Santoy Gap and Santoy 8 .

Maybe when they get their Amisk Gold Project going , and get a mine going , well consider them a Mid-tier . They could also still buy a small explorer or asset of another producer and move to a mid-tier through acquisition . <p> My experience too . I went to an nearly empty city in 2010 and a in a few years it was occupied with a lot of companies and residence . The only reason it was empty is it was under construction and builders want to gradually lease the office out to world class companies . They were extremely selective . It is extremely fancy as well . The West does not understand Chinese way of construction . Western cities will be under construction for decades and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be done in a few years . Everyone should have seen chinese construction videos . They were lightening fast . There are busy activities going on so it could be dangerous to live in .

There is only one city which is truly empty , Erdos , the place Chengis Khan was buried . It is a mistake of city planning . It started with extremely positive growth of coal production and the city did not realize that the area is too remote and coal industry has been in a decline . <p> On January 30 , 2016 at 8:40 am , Frank from moscow CCFsays : <p> good added points . <p> On January 30 , 2016 at 8:45 am , Dragonitesays : <p> The city is named Kangba Shi in Erdos district <p> On January 30 , 2016 at 5:13 pm , Excelsiorsays : <p> Agreed about Jayants perspective having followed up and visited many of the cities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I always appreciate you perspective and insights into China as well , based on your experience , and contact with people in the mix of daily life in the East . <p> On January 30 , 2016 at 9:11 am , Chris in Thailandsays : <p> Jayant Bhandari is well spoken and a real smart guy .

They have real corruption even deeper than our own . <p> I generally find Stockmans views worthwhile , but this seems extreme . Maybe you could offer some balance to this perspective ? <p> On January 30 , 2016 at 8:20 pm , dragonitesays : <p> I have a lot of respect for Stockman . However , I feel he is more bearish than he should be . On the side of China , all US and western politicians are trained to hate China . I have been here for nearly 28 years and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . China seems suffers two sources of hatred from western society . First one is that it has been always on the opposite side of Western allies and present a challenge to the west . Western countries have a general frustration of not being able to control China , like what they have done to India and Japan . The second aspect I feel that white population in general do not think other races as equals . So you can see that any time China has succeeded in doing something , it is always accused of copying US even on something China is doing better . China 's success in the recent decades is not because of communism . It is because people abandoned communism and chase wealth with great enthusiasm . People work hard to get rich and save a lot of money which can be used as investment . Like my parents for example , their pension is around 7500 yuan a month total but their cash saving is around 800,000 yuans in the bank . There are some mal-investment in China for sure but China does need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traffic in China you will agree . In last two decades , China has built huge number of bullet trains , subways and other transportation facilities including rail way and high way to the Tibet plateau . These projects have high demand and people feel really convenient . In the 90s , it was very inconvenient for me to see friends outside of Beijing when I went back . Now I just need to give them a call and many of them will jump on the trains and get there in hours . It is especially helpful when Chinese new year time , like now . As for the pentagon and other western imitations , they sell in China . Chinese in general are reversely racist so they consider white civilization more superior . Copies of the western buildings and even cities sell well . There is a city in South China which copies Paris . So western people do n't understand it and consider it waste but they do bring profit for the builders . In general , China is not controlled by bankers since for the last couple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prostitutes . People hate them and consider them immoral . It has improved tremendously but not completely gone away yet . If Chinese bankers behaves like the way Wall Street is doing , there will be massive attacks from the people . There have been already many incidents the workers who lost their job or facing job loss killed the people who sold them out . In the last few years , China has slowed down to less than half of the growth like before . First , the previous growth rate is too high and created imbalances , so it is not sustainable . China also suffers impact of global slowdown as an exporter . In addition , the anti-corruption initiative by President Xi has caused a lot of local officials hesitate to act . They now prefer safety over achievements . This was exactly what happened during 1990-1994 , after Deng put down student unrest and started clean up corruption . Officials were frozen due to their fear . However , people on the grass root feel better than before . It is the first time I hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is very unusual . So I feel China will have several years ' slow growth but due to the people 's desire to get rich and the government desire to avoid population revolt , the economy will get through this difficult period . Once the world recovers , China will be better as well . Someone say China is the biggest bubble in history ever . I strongly against this notion since people 's lives have been improved a lot and people have huge savings . In addition , China produces most products people can buy in the shopping centres around the world and enjoys large trade surplus . Bubble economy by definition produce vaporware not real products . <p> I have seen both worlds . I feel China has a long way to improve especially their perception of their standing in the world economy and their confidence . There will be many up and downs before China is recognized as the leader of world economy . However , the state owned economy is declining since privatize the remaining state owned enterprise is one of the major goals of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changed from selling of the property to distribute shares to the public . <p> I still have confidence in China and even the world economy in general . We just need to solve the problem of debt in the rest of the world . China in comparison is relatively light regardless how many times the western economists propose the opposite . <p> On January 30 , 2016 at 8:38 pm , Excelsiorsays : <p> Thanks for sharing your perspective Dragonite . China is a very complex country and marketplace . The misunderstandings and assumptions arise from making blanket statements about a country , its people , it economy , etc These kind of statements are always trying to put a label on somethings and are being too simplistic , ethnocentric , and near-sighted . <p> Very interesting read , so thanks for taking the time to write it and post it . <p> On January 30 , 2016 at 8:47 pm , dragonitesays : <p> You are absolutely right .

He is famous in China to use political analysis to predict movements by major countries to influence world economy . He correctly predicted the economical and financial policies employed by Japan and Europe in recent years in his books . In a sense he is the equivalence of conspiracist like Jim Richards . His prediction is that US has launched a major attack on world financial system by squeezing capital to flow to US to take over from the FED easing policy at high price . Japan and Europe behave like foot soldiers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ currency is the major target and is attacked by the major countries . To counter this , it look like the core opposition countries have pick gold as the weapon to defeat the attempt by US , Japan and Europe .

Not sure why he puts Germany in the mix .

But no one should stop thinking when an expert starts talking . <p> On May 25 , 2017 at 6:54 am , silverbug davesays : <p> Bob Hoye is almost always very interesting with his broadcasts . He can though be really wrong on some things . He was expecting the US stock market to roll over in late 2009 , 2010 and 2011 for another leg down like in 1931 . He then changed it to waiting for the next economic cycle downturn for a breakdown in the markets . This has not happened so far and Dow and S&amp;P500 went to decisive new highs . I think both Bob and Rick underestimate the power of fed manipulation of money supply , interest rates , bond markets , and everything else probably . Something is weird with the whole game with the Fed balance sheet up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 20019 for such a long time until now . Its a new monetary structure somehow . Perhaps it has no precedent and we should expect the unexpected . If ( when ? ) we get another big deflationary debt and stock market crash , I think the central bankers will just double down again on money creation one way or another , perhaps outright buying each crashing market until they own everything , all financial assets or most of them and then they will control everything in the earthly sphere . The whole world bought with a printing press . Maybe that is their final goal ? <p> On May 25 , 2017 at 6:55 am , silverbug davesays : <p> Fed balance sheet up so much and the money multiplier down so much since 2009 I meant ! <p> On May 25 , 2017 at 8:57 am , Matthewsays : <p> Yet , for some reason , the deflationists do n't  learn . Bob does n't  even distinguish between a fiat " senior currency " and a gold-backed one . <p> As an aside , in the spring of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stocks were in a bubble ( the Dow was 13,000+ at the time ) , and I said that they were overvalued but not a bubble . I also said that the Dow chart pointed to over 19,000 little did I know that it would go significantly higher . <p> On May 23 , 2017 at 1:22 pm , Robert Moriartysays : <p> Matthew : <p> Much of the credit/blame for that silver spike belongs to Eric Sprott who was pimping his Silver ETF to beat the band . He convinced people to pay a 26% premium over the price of silver for his ETF . <p> It was a suckers rally the whole way much like bitcoin and the pseudo-currencies today . <p> On May 23 , 2017 at 2:27 pm , Matthewsays : <p> Robert , its a closed-end fund . I 'm sure it will see the same premiums again as the average retail guy gladly pays up for its perceived attributes . It will become one helluva shorting opportunity someday . <p> On May 23 , 2017 at 4:11 pm , Matthewsays : <p> Fwiw , Sprotts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 9 , 2012 . Most investors were apparently even more bullish more than eight months after silver had peaked . That 's quite a bearish divergence when you consider that silver was $20 lower at the beginning of 2012 ( $29 vs $49 ) . <p> On May 23 , 2017 at 8:58 pm , Robert Moriartysays : <p> Matthew : <p> I never did understand that particular action in January of 2012 . It was an outlier . But the premium on the Sprott ETF makes a great sentiment indicator . By the way , sentiment on the dollar appears to mark a turn and Bob Hoye is very positive on the dollar . We could have a black swan event around the dollar . <p> On May 23 , 2017 at 8:17 am , OOTB Jerrysays : <p> BUT WHEN.will it come crashing down .. same game for 4 yrs .. this market should have corrected at 10,000 dow , now 21,000 , next stop 42,000 dow .. = BUT , I agree with RICK <p> Basement dwellers , can now save all their money they have no expenses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ = <p> I am a bit thick here and I know that Rick knows far more about this than I do but TLT has about a 13% upside to the highs of last year at best . <p> But listening to Rick you get the impression that TLT could be going much higher . I get the impression that TLT is more of a safety play than a capital gain play ? <p> On May 23 , 2017 at 9:20 am , Silverdollarsays : <p> So.Rick talks the problems as well as anybody . Warnings of SS and pensions collapsing have been good reading since the late 90s . For years things could n't get any worse , yet they continue to muddle along and actually get worse . The thing all analysts are missing is the tipping point , if there is one . When will we sit down to our table of consequences ? That 's really all that matters since trends can latterly go on for generations , as many of them have . Buying TLT is about as exciting as watching oil based paint dry . And it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ever does ? A concern more timely might be trying to figure out which civilizations will be on the receiving end of the $340 billion of weaponry that Trump OKed for the Saudis . <p> On May 23 , 2017 at 9:56 am , FundamentalAnalysissays : <p> I think the difference this time is that we are now effectively at zero interest rates . So pension schemes are either bidding up the bonds higher and higher to ensure their assets outweight the liabilities , alternatively they are also doing the same in the wider stock market with the blue chip stocks causing a divergence from the fundamentals of the business . Hence you have divi stocks with p/e of 30,40,50 in many cases . The tipping point is when either the pension schemes have to pay out , causing an unwinding of the assets , or if the company have to top up the schemes decreasing profits and /or decreasing the share prices or worse the dividend yields . Basically there will be a limit . However if the underlying companies can get away borrowing at near zero rates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ till the day it does n't  . We know there is a breaking point.but cant figure out when . The longer this continues , the more distorted and dangerous the end result becomes.we could see catastophic losses during the unwinding as all schemes race to unwind first to front run the other <p> I cant imagine why any Libyan might hold an irrational hatred for the West and vent it in a misguided fashion . <p> Whatever is going on , I 'm sure no soul-searching on our part is called for . He probably just hated our freedom . <p> On May 23 , 2017 at 1:26 pm , Robert Moriartysays : <p> GH : <p> Actually it would be quite rational . To fight terrorism , we need to stop creating terrorists . If there are 65 million refugees in the world and only one in 10,000 turns to terror , it means there are 6,499 more suicide bombers out there . That 's a lot of terror . <p> While I do n't  agree with the terrorists , I do understand why they are so pissed . <p> On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> What I do not understand is the logic and morality of terrorists that seems to imply it is reasonable to kill innocent people that have nothing to do with your reason to become a terrorist . If they are mad at the politicians of a country or the behavior of a country , they should logically go after the politicians or leaders of that country . <p> On May 23 , 2017 at 3:40 pm , GHsays : <p> Of course I agree with you , CFS . One wonders why no prominent war mongers with a say in policy-making are ever targeted . And a follow-on wonder , what portion of these attacks are false flags targeting peons in order to get mass support for the warmongers policies ? A non-zero figure , I think it is safe to say . <p> The difference I have with you is that I believe we need to focus on the root of the problem , and that root is not the muslim terrorists . I also think most of the things you say about the Scum terrorist attacks and Imams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opposite direction . In terms of magnitude there is no comparison between the terror the Christian West has directed toward the Muslim world , and vice versa . <p> On May 24 , 2017 at 4:07 am , Robert Moriartysays : <p> CFS : <p> You have to be kidding . Right ? <p> The purpose of terrorism is to terrorize . <p> Why would you attack armed police or the military when you can target children ? We have 22 people killed on an average weekend in Iraq and no one cares but one 8 year old is killed in England and everyone is aghast . <p> I feel sad that even a 23 year old feels it is worth dying to make a statement . And the response from the idiot politicians is to claim that the bomber was a coward . How stupid can you get ? It takes a lot of courage to blow yourself up . <p> The attack on Libya was a war crime by every measure . The US , Israel , the UK and France deposed the most responsible leader in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hole of crime and corruption . If the world was reasonable we would have a war crimes trial and hang all of the bastards who launched that war after a fair and swift trial .

Especially when one of those charts is ahead of the other ( also known as leading ) . The post below from Market Anthropology presents the similarities between treasuries ( TLT ) and the US dollar . <p> The charts speak for themselves but let us know what you guys think . Are we in for a significant drop in the dollar ? <h> The $s April Showers Can Bring May Flowers to Gold <p> Regardless of how hawkish the Fed frames possible future rate hikes this year , we suspect a cyclical breakdown in the US dollar index to unfold . Moreover , by our estimates of the leading market breakdown in US Treasuries last November , the window for a dollar break appears to be now open and extended through April . <p> Similar to the failed breakout in long-term Treasuries last summer that subsequently resulted in the severe correction in bonds , the dollar index has followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with last November 's upside breakout 100 . Should the index break below current levels , long-term trendline support will be tested directly below 98.50 and likely fail . <p> *Click to enlarge images* <p> As we 've noted over the years , the relationship between Treasuries and the dollar is highly dynamic , and at times " quite muddled " depending upon the time frame and markets you look at . Granted , this is true for all markets , yet even more so with Treasuries , in part due to the range of durations and also when intermarket correlations are interpreted through yields that inherently behave inverse to their corresponding bond . Simply put " it 's complicated to read and even more confusing to describe . <p> That said , from a macro perspective we have viewed the dollar following cyclical trends in long-term yields by several years , while over the intermediate term the dollar has followed more structural pivots in Treasuries by several months . <p> Shorter-term " and as frequently seen in most intermarket relationships , correlations fluctuate between the positive and negative poles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhibiting an inverse correlation extreme coming into January " the last of which was present during the previous cyclical top in the dollar in the first half of 2002 . Consequently , when Treasuries broke down from the failed breakout last November , the dollar broke out . Since then , however , the dollar fell short of making new highs this month as long-term Treasuries recently made new lows . <p> Our interpretation is that the dollar is set to follow Treasuries breakdown lead with the last lagged pivot ( 5-6 months ) of the cycle , which should mark a pattern break as the dollar turns cyclically lower without a corresponding leading move lower in Treasuries . As we described in previous notes , while we would n't be surprised to see a final leg lower in Treasuries manifest along the lines of the 1987 breakdown to complete the move , over the longer-term we like them from a relative performance perspective to equities .

This was an interesting sentence from the report <p> Interestingly , whereas the widely held view is that the Fed 's programme of QE has weakened the dollar , in reality the dollar reached a low before QE started . This implies that all the money printing that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen its balance sheet rise from less than one trillion dollars to almost 4.5 trillion dollars , has not weakened the dollar .

Getting back to your example the other day about the gold price and the Feds balance sheet we note that a significant amount of time passed before gold responded in the very early 1960s .

Its an object lesson for any and all land owners . Much appreciated . <p> PORTLAND , Maine ( AP ) " The summer air is sizzling as the Fourth of July approaches , yet 86-year-old Richard Perkins already worries about how he s going to stay warm this winter . President Donald Trump has proposed eliminating heating aid for low-income Americans , claiming its no longer necessary and rife with fraud . People neednt worry about being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not cut off customers in the dead of winter . The heating program provides a critical lifeline for people like Perkins , and officials close to the program do n't  see any widespread fraud . Guidelines for winter shutoffs by utilities vary from state to state and do n't  apply to heating oil , a key energy source in the brittle New England winter . " Its beyond my thinking that anyone could be that cruel , " said Perkins , a retired restaurateur who relies on the program to keep warm in Ogunquit , Maine . The proposal to kill the program , which has distributed $3.4 billion to about 6 million households this fiscal year , will face strong opposition in Congress . Forty-three senators from mostly cold-weather states already signed a letter urging the Republican chairman and ranking Democrat on an appropriations subcommittee to ensure funding for the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program , known in many states by its acronym , LIHEAP ( pronounced LY-heep ) . In Maine , the poorest state in New England , the program helped about 77,000 people over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarter of eligible households , said Deborah Turcotte of MaineHousing , which helps to run the program . <p> But then Congress never can find a program to cut .. No matter how abused . <p> On July 2 , 2017 at 5:45 pm , CFSsays : <p> WASHINGTON ( AP ) " President Donald Trump is making a weekend push to get a Republican Senate bill to repeal and replace former President Barack Obamas health care law " across the finish line , " Trumps top legislative aide said Sunday , maintaining that a repeal-only option also remained in play if Republicans cant reach agreement . Marc Short , the White Houses legislative director , said Trump was making calls to wavering senators and insisted they were " getting close " on passing a bill . But Short said Trump continues to believe that repeal-only legislation should also be considered after raising the possibility last Friday . Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell , R-Ky. , has dismissed that suggestion and said he intended to proceed with legislation being negotiated over the July 4 recess . " We hope when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a vote , " Short said . But he added : " If the replacement part is too difficult for Republicans to get together , then let 's go back and take care of the first step of repeal . " Trump on Friday tweeted the suggestion of repealing the Obama-era law right away and then replacing it later , an approach that GOP leaders and the president himself considered but dismissed months ago as impractical and politically unwise . But the tweet came amid continuing signs of GOP disagreement among moderates and conservatives over the bill . Republicans hold a 52-48 majority in the Senate . Just three GOP defections would doom the legislation , because Democrats are united in opposition . Republicans returned to their home districts late last week , bracing for a flood of phone calls , emails and television advertising from both conservative and liberal groups aimed at pressuring senators . Sen. Bill Cassidy held a town hall meeting last Friday to talk about flood recovery in Baton Rouge , Louisianas capital city , but audience members angry over the GOP health care bill at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process . " I wish we werent doing it one party , " Cassidy said Sunday , adding he remains undecided on how he will vote . Trumps suggestion had the potential to harden divisions within the GOP as conservatives complain that McConnells bill does not go far enough in repealing Obamas health care law while moderates criticize it as overly harsh in kicking people off insurance rolls , shrinking the Medicaid safety net and increasing premiums for older Americans . " Its not easy making America great again , is it ? " McConnell said late Friday . He has previously indicated that if Republicans fail to reach agreement , he will have to negotiate with Democrats , who want to fix Obamas health care law without repealing it . Short said the White House remained hopeful after Senate Republicans submitted two versions of the bill to the Congressional Budget Office for scoring over the weeklong recess . Texas Sen. Ted Cruz is pushing a conservative version that aims to aggressively reduce costs by giving states greater flexibility to create separate higher-risk pools . The other seeks to bolster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tax boost on high earners . Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price said negotiations over the Senate bill were focusing on ways to address the issue of Medicaid coverage so that " nobody falls through the cracks , " combating the opioid crisis , as well as giving families more choice in selecting their insurance plan . " We think that Leader McConnell and his senators within the Senate are working to try to get this piece of legislation on track , " Price said . But conservative Sen. Rand Paul , R-Ky. , said he did n't  think a repeal-and-replace bill could win 50 votes . Both he and Sen. Ben Sasse , R-Neb. , have been urging McConnell to consider a repeal-only bill first . " I do n't  think were getting anywhere with the bill we have . Were at an impasse , " Paul said . He criticized Senate leaders , saying they were seeking to win over moderates with multibillion dollar proposals to combat the opioid epidemic and boost tax subsidies to help lower-income people get coverage . " The bill is just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ornaments , and its not repeal , " Paul said . " I think you can get 52 Republicans for clean repeal . " <p> On July 2 , 2017 at 6:02 pm , DCsays : <p> One of Trumps agenda items was to do away with these rogue " government " ( not ) agencies that have no oversight but act as legislative bodies with impunity ( read that , bought and paid for by whomever has the money to fund their self-serving agenda ) . I certainly hope he manages to do it at some point . <p> It struck me when he first took office that his refusal to immediately fill all those " vacancies " in the White House was part of that plan . Had those positions been necessary and helpful to him , he would have done . But I think he saw the bloat and this is one way of finding out just how necessary or unnecessary a position is . If its bloat , then he can leave it vacant or dissolve the post altogether .
