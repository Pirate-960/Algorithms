But why would he ? Unless coerced . Her pulse kicked up a beat and her fingers clenched and unclenched the sacres red leather hilts . The movement reopened the wound on her hand , and fresh blood seeped through the bandages , but the pain only served to hone her awareness .

Or is it six foxgloves to kill four fully grown guests ? <p> Unfortunately , what Sophronia saw when she looked up did not fill her with confidence . Lady Linette stood at the front of the class wearing an austere expression that clashed with her copious yellow curls and a bonnet covered with drooping silk lilacs . She was wearing a good deal of face paint and a purple-and-jade plaid dress of immense proportions . It was neither her expression nor her location at the front of the class that made Sophronia nervous .

Sister Mattie was a bit of mystery ; her preference for a simulated nuns habitwide-skirted and to the current fashion , with a wimple partly configured like a bonnetremained unexplained . The girls saw her as a nice sort of mystery and one of the more benign teachers , so they mostly respected her eccentric choice of dress . <p> Sophronias fellow students were looking on with wide eyes . Sidheag and Agatha tensed sympathetically .

Their multiple skirts smushed together . Neither minded the wrinkles as they linked arms for comfort . Mademoiselle Geraldines Finishing Academy was housed in a massive airship that looked like three dirigibles crammed together . Its corridors twisted and turned in a noodlelike manner . Sometimes the passageways led up stairs or out onto balconies . Most of the time , they simply got darker , lit by gas lamps that looked like upside-down parasols . Whatever attire the corridors had been designed to accommodate , proper ladys dress was not one of them . <p> Lady Linette led them toward the upper squeak decks .

All the models , from buttler to footmech to clangermaid , had protocols that instructed them to ignore students in the company of teachers . Most of the hallways were laid down with a single track upon which the schools many mechanical servants trundled , performing the myriad of menial tasks needed to keep a ladies seminary running smoothly .

I spared a moment to try to find a ley line , not surprised to find I was too deep underground . <p> My boots trod upon a plush off-white carpet . The furniture was tasteful , and there was occasional artwork under spotlights . Floor-to-ceiling curtains at regular intervals gave the illusion of windows behind them .

I wondered if he begged Piscary like that , knowing that he had been asking for blood . And I wondered if , to Kisten , the taking of blood was a casual commitment or something more . <p> The sound of muted traffic drew my attention from the picture of what looked like Piscary and Lindburgh sharing a pint in a British pub . Steps slow to hid his limp , Kisten led me into a sunken living room .

My anxiety strengthened at his bedroom-casual appearance . Great . This is just what I needed . <p> " Nice window , " I said , thinking it was better than Trent 's , the toad .

Piscary cleared his throat , and I looked back . A wisp of black hair showed behind the V of his robe , and his calves visible through the wire mesh of the table were hard with muscle .

I found my feet , adrenaline pounding through me as I headed for the elevator . <p> Piscary jerked me back . <p> " You son of a bitch ! " I screamed . " Leave me alone ! " <p> He gave my head a smack to make me see stars . <p> I crumpled . Panting , I lay at his feet as he stood above me , an amulet in his hand . He smeared my blood across it , and it glowed red . His hand was enveloped in a red haze as he nudged my fallen chair farther onto the surrounding carpet . I pulled my head up , seeing past my hair that the pattern on the tiled floor before us made a perfect circle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was one piece of marble . It was a summoning circle . <p> " God help me , " I whispered , knowing what was going to happen when Piscary tossed the amulet to land dead center of the circle .

@@37756596 @6756596/ <p> Book Description Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is the second novel in the Harry Potter series written by J. K. Rowling . The plot follows Harry 's second year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry , during which a series of messages on the walls on the school 's corridors warn that the " Chamber of Secrets " has been opened and that the " heir of Slytherin " will kill all pupils who do not come from all-magical families . These threats are followed by attacks which leave residents of the school " petrified " ( that is , frozen ) . Throughout the year , Harry and his friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger investigate the attacks , and Harry is confronted by Lord Voldemort , who is attempting to regain full power . The book was published in the United Kingdom on 2 July 1998 by Bloomsbury and in the United States on 2 June 1999 by Scholastic Inc . Although Rowling found it difficult to finish the book , it won high praise and awards from critics , young readers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was perhaps too frightening for younger children . Some religious authorities have condemned its use of magical themes , while others have praised its emphasis on self-sacrifice and on the way in which a person 's character is the result of the person 's choices . Several commentators have noted that personal identity is a strong theme in the book , and that it addresses issues of racism through the treatment of non-magical , non-human and non-living characters . Some commentators regard the diary as a warning against uncritical acceptance of information from sources whose motives and reliability can not be checked . Institutional authority is portrayed as self-serving and incompetent . The film version of Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets , released in 2002 , became the third film to exceed $600 million in international box office sales and received generally favourable reviews . However , The Lord of the Rings : The Two Towers won the Saturn Award for the Best Fantasy Film . Video games loosely based on Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets were also released for several platforms , and most obtained favourable reviews .

No , I 'm sorry , that 's Eddie on the left and Bobby Jr . on the right . " She still looked unsure . " Well , that 's embarrassing , not knowing your own flesh and blood .

" Then there 's some space , and that 's ap followed by what looks to be either ana or ano . " <p> King straightened up , looking thoughtful . " It appears something was lying in this drawer , and those letters somehow stained the wood , imprinting it . " <p> " It might have gotten wet , " suggested Savannah . <p> King leaned in and took a long whiff of the drawer . He looked at Savannah . " Did Bobby drink in his room ? " <p> " Daddy drink ?

@@37756600 @6756600/ <p> Penelope risked a glance at him . He was not looking at her , but staring across the river as though he studied something she could not see . The faint white patches in the corners of his eyes were pale against his darker skin . <p> " That will not keep you safe , " he said after a time . " As long as someone believes you are a Nvengarian princess and precious to me , you are not safe . " <p> Precious to me . <p> She tried to sound cold , " I do not want a marriage of convenience . " He turned to her , brushing his fingers over her hair . " I know that . " <p> " And yet , that is what you try to rush me into . " <p> His hand moved to the nape of her neck . " I hope it will be more than that to you . " <p> " Is it more than that to you ? " <p> He leaned down and buried his lips in her hair . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marriage will mean to me . " <p> When he spoke in that tone , when he caressed her , it was so easy to believe he loved her . If only she had n't heard those womenhis mistresses <p> speaking of him as though they owned him , as though he 'd run back to them as soon as they crooked their fingers . <p> What had he whispered to them in the night ? Not words of love , or they 'd have boasted of it . But he 'd touched them with warm fingers and kissed their hair <p> Penelope pulled away . " If not for the prophecy , you never would have come here . You never would have looked at me twice . " <p> " You are half right . " He did not reach for her again , but twined his strong fingers over his knee . " I would never have known that Little Marching existed if not for Sasha . But had I encountered you in London or elsewhere , I would have looked at you for a long , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but she quickly suppressed it . " I am not fishing for flattery . " <p> " I know . " He glanced at her bare calves and feet in the water , his look appreciative . " I envy the fish come to nibble your toes . " Penelope resisted pulling her legs up and covering them with her dress . He grinned , the side of his mouth pulling . <p> " What I mean is , you never would have journeyed here and proposed to me if not for your prophecy , " she said , a little shakily . <p> " Very likely not . " He nodded once . " Although I like to believe that fate has been driving us together . " <p> " That would indeed be a fairy story , " she said . " The story you told me , the one about the princess in the towershe ended not by running off with the handsome stranger from far away , but by staying with the true and trusted friend she 'd known all her life . That is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> He looked at her with a touch of bewilderment . " It is only a story , Penelope . It has no meaning . " <p> " All tales have meaning . Usually , ' Be good and patient , and you shall be rewarded . ' " <p> " In my experience , that never happens . " <p> She glanced at him . " But it should be true . That is why people tell the stories . " <p> He slid his hand under her hair again , teasing the curls at her nape . <p> " When people tell our story , they will tell how I traveled many miles and through great peril to find you waiting for me at the end of the journey . " His smile returned . " You made the peril worth every moment . " <p> " You have a honeyed tongue . " <p> The smiled turned wicked . " No , but you give me a good idea . " She blushed . He made his wanting for her so plain . <p> " We are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " You like this word , convenience . " He sat down next to her and began to pull off his boots . <p> " I will be plainer , then . Mr. White wished me to marry him and have his children so that he could ignore me and do as he pleased . I would not do it for him , and I will not do it for you . I refuse to be a wife who is convenient . " <p> He pulled off his second boot and tossed it aside , then stripped off his stockings and dangled his feet in the pool . <p> His bare brown calves hung close to her slender ones , wiry black hair curling down his shins and onto his strong feet . They sat side by side , hips and shoulders touching . <p> It felt shockingly intimate , even more so than when he 'd kissed her and touched her in her bedchamber . This was casual , an implication that he had every right to be casual with her . <p> " Penelope , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " For me to travel three thousand miles in search of a bride is not convenient . It is not convenient to leave my kingdom vulnerable to a scheming Grand Duke , nor is it convenient to scrape and bow to your joke of a Regent so that I may hold England 's support . " He slid his hand to her thigh . " And it is not convenient to find you here like this , knowing that if I take you the way I wish to , my very superstitious Nvengarians will declare the prophecy void , and I will have done all for nothing . No , I do not find this at all convenient . " <p> She bit her lip . " I did not mean " <p> " I will marry you , Penelope . I will do anything to fulfill the prophecy and save my kingdom . I want to do it with soft words , but if I have to throw you over the pommel of my saddle and gallop away with you , I will . " His hard expression told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he dropped his suave and civilized facade , she saw the true man , the one who had survived hunger and pain and darkness and hatred . She had no doubt that if he wanted , he 'd sweep her up and gallop away with her , like a nomad from a desert tribe . <p> " That would be a bit uncomfortable for a three-thousand-mile journey , " she said in a small voice . <p> " Not for me , love . I could rest my hand on your very fine backside all the way . " <p> She blushed . " You really should not say things like that . " <p> " You must grow used to me complimenting your body . Your backside is fine , as are your breasts . " He looked into the water . " And your toes are adorable . " <p> " Now you have become Prince Charming again . " <p> His look turned curious . " Is that how you think of me ? " <p> " No , I think of you as exasperating . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He twined his bare foot , long and broad , around hers . " Fall in love with me , Penelope . " <p> She quirked a brow . " Like every other woman across the breadth of Europe ? " <p> His glance turned questioning , and Penelope wanted to slap her hand across her mouth . She 'd not meant to admit that she 'd heard the shameful conversation of his paramours . A well-bred woman never discussed such matters . <p> " Think you every woman in Europe in love with me ? " he asked . " I assure you , that is not true . I believe my mother loved me , but she died when I was very small . " <p> " Oh , " she said , deflating . " I am sorry . About your mother , I mean . " <p> " It was a tragedy . Also very dramatic , Nvengarian style . She climbed upon the gate tower of my father 's castle and shot herself in the head . " Penelope stared at him in horror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tone neutral . " It was her finest moment . My father was evil , but she got her revenge . Instead of quietly poisoning herself and letting the incident be swept under the carpets , she stood up on a moonlit night in full view of the city , and announced to the world exactly what my father had done to her . She showed the truth of what he was , a madman to fear and hate . " He stirred the water with his foot . " At the time , I was very angry at her for leaving me alone , but I understand now that she had to do it . Her death was her only weapon against him , and she used it well . " He fell silent a moment . " I do not know why I tell you these things . I never speak of them to anyone . " <p> " Damien . " Her voice held anguish . <p> He smiled . " Do not feel sorry for me , Penelope . My childhood is behind me . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men trying to kill you right and left ? " <p> " A few dodged knives is nothing compared to the barbs of my father , love . " <p> He chuckled as though he 'd told her a reassuring story . Penelope traced the sinews on the back of his hand . The scars that crisscrossed his skin spoke more clearly than words of the harshness of his life . <p> " It is better now , " he repeated , " because I have found you . " Flattery again . His eyes had gone dark , and his head dipped toward hers as though he was ready to kiss her . <p> " You are asking me to leave behind everything I have ever known , " she said desperately . " You wish me to ride off into the wilderness with you on the strength of a silver ring and Sasha 's prophecy . " <p> " I know . " He smoothed her cheek . " And you are brave enough and strong enough to do it . You have the heart of a lion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He nuzzled her , his breath warm on her skin . " You could face down the entire Council of Dukes and Alexander himself . You could have even faced down my father . " <p> " The man who put you into a dungeon ? " She stopped . " I am very angry at him for that , you know . " <p> " You see ? You have fight in you , Penelope . You will make a fine princess . Nvengarians love a woman with fight . " <p> " I have never fought anyone in my life , " she protested . He shrugged . " I wonder what it must have been to jilt your Mr. Reuben White in the face of all the world . The English are not kind to a woman who decides to send a man away . They believe she should swallow what the gentleman does so that she may have a husband and a name . In Nvengaria , we admire a woman who takes a knife to a cheating betrothed . " <p> She blanched . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you are civilized , and English . It took much courage for you to defy Mr. White and your mother and father , and the entire English ton , did it not ? " <p> She nodded , remembering the pleading arguments from her mother , the cool anger of her father , the outrage of Reuben , who threatened to sue for breach of contract , the stares and whispers when she went out in public , the label of jilt . <p> But she could not have sold herself to a life of misery . She had dried her tears and gone on , pretending she was not in pain . Shortly afterward , her father had died , and the grief of that , coupled with the lack of funds to keep them in London , had forced her to think about other things . <p> " It was difficult , " she said . <p> " You understate it , I believe . Yet , you did it . You defied them . A lesser woman would have accepted her lot and married him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with you . " <p> He chuckled , a warm sound . " Penelope , you are a fine one at debate . As I said , you will defy the Council of Dukes . " <p> He slid off his coat and laid it carefully on the bank . Next he untied his cravat , unwound it from his neck , and folded it over his coat . He began to unbutton his waistcoat , tanned fingers deft and sure on the buttons . Penelope 's gaze riveted to him as he shrugged off the waistcoat . Beneath his London-tailored clothes , he had the body of a warrior . No wonder the Regent regarded him with jealousy . <p> He stripped off his shirt . His torso , brown with sun , was tight and strong , muscles moving under the skin with animal grace . Black curls dusted his chest , spreading across his pectorals , thinning where his flat , male nipples lay brown-red again his skin . His arms were large with muscle , round and hard biceps tapering to hollows on the insides of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his skin there even more tanned , the part of his body that saw the most sun . She had never seen a man completely bare-chested before , and she found that she wanted to look at him , to explore with her gaze what he was . <p> She wanted to touch , too . She imagined her pale fingers on the brown flesh , tracing collarbone and hollow of throat , the damp skin over his Adam 's apple . She 'd move down to feather the indent between his pectorals , letting his dark curls of hair twist round her fingertips . Then to his brown nipples , drawing them lightly between her fingers , discovering whether they felt like her own or different . <p> She flicked her gaze to his face , knowing her eyes would betray her hunger , but not knowing how to hide it . She traced the sharp line of his jaw , the black curled hair that trailed behind his ears to his bare , strong neck . He smelled of sweat and salt , and she wondered if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across his throat . <p> He smiled at her , his lips moving slowly , as though he knew she wanted to taste him and liked it . <p> He lifted himself on the log , balancing on flat hands , arms tightening , and , before she could speak , he slid down into the water . <p> The pool was deep . Damien dove into the cool depths , the water heavenly after the warm summer sun . <p> His arousal was screaming at him . Damn , but he wanted her . Finding her here with her skirts rucked to her knees , her bare legs dangling , her toes tracing languid circles in the water , had made him hard as a rock . He 'd argued with her to keep his mind off her beddable body , but to no use . Thank God the water was cold . <p> He surfaced , and shook water from his hair . She was watching him , eyes round . " What are you doing ? " <p> " Swimming . " <p> " What about assassins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have men stationed along the hill and river to watch . " Penelope hastily pulled her dress over her legs . " Good heavens . You might have warned me . " <p> " My men are trained to look without looking , " he said . " Does it make sense in English ? " <p> " I suppose , " she said . <p> He laughed . She was so pretty with the sun on her hair , her lip drawn down in confusion . He wanted to kiss her and kiss her . He wanted to hold her against him in the water , to lift her dress and settle her on his very needy erection . <p> He swam across the pool , then dove again , reveling in the soothing water . He surfaced , right at her feet . <p> She looked at him in surprise . Slanting her a wicked grin , he lifted her bare , clean toes and drew one into his mouth . <p> He expected her to gasp and pull away , but she stretched out her foot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She 'd look so in bed , he imagined , lying back and waiting for him , lips parted . <p> He nibbled the toe , then suckled it , loving the taste of the water and her skin . Her posture pressed her breasts against her thin gown , her nipples tiny points against the fabric . <p> He 'd never seen such a sensuous woman . Hers was a natural sensuality , free from the artifice of court women , closer to the wild beauty of the women of his own country . <p> He kissed her toes , one at a time , then lifted the other foot and did the same . <p> She watched him , smiling slightly , the hem of her dress dangling in the water . His hardness grew unbearably tight . <p> " I want to see you , " he said . <p> He held each small foot in his palms . Gently he pulled her legs apart , the loose skirt sliding to her knees . Her chest rose with quickened breath . He stepped between her legs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her calf . The salt taste of her skin made his blood hotter still . He slid the skirt upward , dipping his tongue behind her knee . <p> She gasped . He expected her to pull away , perhaps to kick water into his face , but she remained still . The pulse in the fold of her knee beat faster . <p> " I want to see you , " he said again . <p> She had every right to refuse him and send him away . They were not yet betrothed . Even in Nvengaria , an unmarried woman would admonish a man for making improper advances , unless she wanted them , of course . Slowly Penelope reached down , and with slow fingers , drew her skirt up to bare her thighs . <p> Damien exhaled . Her lovely legs stretched to him , long and just a little plump . He kissed her thigh above her knee , and drew his tongue all the way along it to the shadow under her skirt . <p> She stiffened , but did not pull away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thigh . He watched her fingers close on the cloth , and then , as his heartbeat soared , she pulled the skirt the rest of the way up . A thread of sweet curls swirled over her mound and twisted along her opening . His arousal strained toward her , knowing where it wanted to go . He dragged in a breath . <p> " Penelope , I have not the words in English to say how beautiful you are . " <p> She said nothing . Her face was rosy pink , her green-gold eyes fixed on him as though she worried what he thought of her . <p> He braced his hands on either side of her opening , and pushed her still wider . He let his thumbs come together in the middle , stroking down over her mound . <p> She gasped , eyes widening . He was , without a doubt , the first person to ever touch her there . Her honey flowed onto his hands , sweet and warm . <p> " Penelope , do you know what release is ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You have never touched yourself ? Felt the release of it ? " <p> " Never . " <p> Surprising . The ladies of London and Paris liked to tell him at length how much they enjoyed themselves alone in their beds . So much so that at times , he left them to it while he sought a tavern to enjoy ale and conversation . <p> From the look on Penelope 's face , the thought had never occurred to her . <p> " I will teach you what it feels like , " he said . <p> Her gaze locked with his , as though she was afraid to look away . Her lips parted , moist and red . <p> He could touch and taste her all he wanted , as long as he did n't ram his greedy hardness straight into her . Being inside her might negate the prophecy , but staying outside would not . <p> He rubbed her mound again , loving the hot folds that wanted to close over his thumbs . He lifted his hand and licked her moisture from it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hand in protest . " Damien , your bodyguards . " <p> " Can not see a thing . " <p> They had been trained to look out for danger but to give him his privacy . Life did not go well for a bodyguard who did not . Some of them were left over from his father 's rule , fanatically devoted to the Imperial Prince , whoever he happened to be . They would not ogle her ; they 'd be more worried about her trying to harm him . <p> They would have to learn that Penelope was on his side , an extension of him , not his enemy . She had been made for him . He tasted her on his skin and felt her become part of him . <p> He stroked her again , letting his fingers nudge a little inside of her . She closed her eyes , one hand threading his hair . <p> " That is the way , my love , " he whispered . " Feel the joy of it . " She arched toward him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and lowered his mouth to her . <p> Sweet , hot , fiery taste . He loved her gasp of startled pleasure , and the deeper moan that followed it . Lovely innocent , feeling for the first time . She was his , and no other man 's . The fervent possessiveness of his people welled up inside him , and he did n't bother to control it . <p> Her scent surrounded him , her taste drove him wild . He suckled her , earning small cries of pleasure while her hips rocked forward . She wanted him with the same mindlessness with which he wanted her . <p> Unlike when they 'd been in her bedchamber , though , he knew he could control himself . For now . Then , a dark need had swept through him , as though a force from outside had taken over his thoughts . This time , he could fully enjoy her without the crazed clutch on his mind . He flicked his tongue over her beautiful mound , faster and faster , smiling as she jerked and moaned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he ignored the pain . She was ready ripe for it . Beautiful , beautiful woman . She dragged in a long breath , and then she came , her first surprised cries ringing out to the quiet rush of the river . <p> Damien grasped her hips and dragged her down into the water with him . His mouth landed hard on hers , taking her screams of delight into him . She instinctively wrapped her legs around him , clinging to him , positioning her needing opening directly over his arousal . <p> He rocked his hips , loving the friction , while he kissed her . He drove his tongue in deep , pressing her , making her taste him as much as he tasted her . Her nails bit his skin , sharp points digging into his back . Eventually , her cries lessened , her frantic hands stilled , and at last , she eased her lips from his . She regarded him languidly her lips swollen , a woman first awakened to the wild feelings inside her . <p> " Did I have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoothed her hair and kissed the corner of her mouth . " That was release . Do you understand now why we crave it so ? " <p> She nodded . " It was most strange . " <p> " Would you like to do it again ? " <p> Her eyes widened a little . " I can do that again ? " <p> " As many times as you want , vixen . " <p> " As many times ? " She drew a breath . " I do not know if I can . I feel quite exhausted . And at the same time " <p> " You feel , as you say , exhilarated ? " <p> " Yes . Exhilarated . " She lay her head on his shoulder . " Do you feel the same ? " <p> " No . " <p> " Oh . " She sounded disappointed . <p> " I will feel it on our betrothal night . I will teach you how to bring me to release . " <p> " I see . " She looked shy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learn one another , " he said , trying to stifle his anticipation . " That is what the betrothal ritual is for . To show the world that we will be bound in marriage , and to learn to pleasure each other 's bodies . After that night , we will have no fear of the carnal pleasures we will seek in our marriage . " <p> She smiled into his shoulder . " That sounds much different from English marriage . " <p> " Nvengarian husbands enjoy making certain that their wives are pleased in bed , and they invent many and varied ways to do it . Do English husbands not do this ? " <p> " I have not heard so . But my married acquaintances tell me very little . " She sounded frustrated . <p> " Do not worry . I will tell you everything you need to know . " She lifted her head and smiled at him , eyes starry , then she suddenly realized that he 'd pulled her into the pool and they were up to their shoulders in water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gasped . <p> " Take it off . " He scooped her against him and began unfastening the hooks in the back . <p> She did not protest much as he helped her untangle her arms from the gown and pull it from her legs . He lifted it from the water and laid it across the log , where it hung , deflated and wrinkled with water . She wore no stays under the light summer gown . Her shift molded to her body , the tips of her breasts dark and large . The wet cotton clinging to her was almost more erotic than if she 'd been bare . <p> He lifted her again , hands under her buttocks , the water making her buoyant . Her wet lips roved his as she wrapped her legs around him again ; she was no longer shy about kissing him . " I love you , " he said . Her eyes were heavy , face flushed with heat . " Say it in Nvengarian . I want to learn . " <p> He smiled . " We say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I love you , it is amor dem . " <p> She smoothed his wet hair from his forehead . " Amor dem . " He laughed . " No , that is for a woman . To say it to me , you would say amor das . " <p> She wrinkled her nose . " I do so hate conjugation . My French tutor always laughed at me . " <p> " It is English that is confusing . With no gender . Saying the same thing to a woman or to a man sounds very strange to us . As though you are hermaphrodites . " <p> She laughed , a sound like sweet chimes . " I never thought of it like that . " He waited . Her laughter faded . She studied his face , as though memorizing it . " Damien . " She brushed her finger down the bridge of his nose and over his lips . " Amor das . " <p> " I love you , too , Penelope . " <p> She did not ask again if he truly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her eyes intent . " How do you say , I want you ? " He brought his lips close to hers . " You would say to a lover , gushan das . " <p> " Oh . " She kissed him lightly . <p> He smiled . " Will you say it ? " <p> " You already know I want you . " <p> " Yes . " He was going to take her to bed and love her for days . She laid her head on his shoulder . " If I were cruel , " she said softly , " I would ask you to make love to me now , and so break the prophecy . " She lifted her head . " Then I would not have to go with you to Nvengaria . " He pretended to consider the strategy . " True . But it would not work . " <p> " Why not ? " <p> She sounded offended . He laughed . " Because I am in love with you . I will marry you and take you home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You are giving me no choice . " <p> " You have a choice . " He tightened his arms around her . " Your choice is to come with me willingly , or to come with me unwillingly . I can imagine entertaining possibilities in both directions . " <p> She looked puzzled . " Why would it entertain you if I was unwilling ? " His entire body throbbed . " Because then I could have the joy of taming you . If I must throw you over my pommel and ride off with you , you will learn my true nature . The one that tells me you are mine , and I will teach you to be so . " <p> Her eyes widened . The idea frightened her , but not entirely . He ran his fingertips down her spine . " I can think of many ways to train you to be mine . In fact , I somewhat hope you will be unwilling . " <p> " Ways ? " <p> " Yes . " He ran his hand up to encircle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ release you until you did my bidding . " <p> She moved a little in his arms , brushing his aching groin . " How could I do your bidding with my hands tied ? " <p> " Now that , my love , I will have to teach you when I have you in my bed . " She would be naked , her hair down , and she 'd squirm against her bonds . She 'd look up at him and ask him , in faint trepidation , what he wanted her to do . <p> The vision was compelling . He gritted his teeth . Penelope was driving him over the brink , but he was so enjoying the fall . <p> " You are a dangerous one , " he said . " But remember , whether I compromise you too soon or no , I will take you home with me . " She opened her mouth to argue , but he kissed her before she could say a word . She got lost in the kiss , her body grasping what it was supposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd said in his own tongue that she loved him . He also liked the way her tongue moved in his mouth . He would teach her more Nvengarian , every naughty phrase she could repeat to him when they were in bed on long winter nights . And short summer nights . And all the nights in between . <p> He deepened the kiss , feeling her fingertips on the scratches she 'd put on his back . Yes , this mating would be fierce indeed . <p> He knew the women , one the Russian he 'd been with when Misk had brought him his father 's ring . The other was English , a baroness who had a fetish for sleeping with foreign nobility . She collected them , she bragged . Penelope gasped . He thought she 'd fling herself from his arms , but after one startled look upward , she suddenly pressed her mouth to his and kissed him with all her might . <p> He wanted to laugh , but he let her kiss him . He 'd known that she 'd discover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prince . The ladies the Regent had brought with him were not known for keeping secrets . <p> More brush crackled as the three turned and hurried back to the path . Meagan 's voice floated back to them , swelling with triumph . " Well , they are going to be married . A grand romance , is it not ? " Later , Penelope trotted downstairs in the house , her hand skimming the stair rail . She 'd dried herself and changed her clothes , damp and refreshed from her impromptu swim with Damien . She 'd put on a clean gown and brushed her hair , fastening it in a long tail to let it dry . Damien had gotten Penelope back to the house , both of them sneaking in like naughty children in their wet clothes . She , who never giggled , had n't been able to stop . Damien had had to kiss her to keep her quiet . She felt strange , tired and yet rested , her body trying to grow used to the new feelings Damien had invoked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on her , what wild thoughts could fly through her mind , and how excited and flushed and wonderful her body could feel . When his tongue pressed into her , she 'd thought madness had overtaken her . <p> The intensity of what her body could experience frightened her a little , but at the same time , she longed to feel it again . <p> As she stepped off the last stair , her thoughts still far away , Petri , Damien 's valet , emerged from the sitting room and stopped in front of her . <p> " Highness , " Petri said . " I speak to you , yes ? " Petri did not know as much English as Damien or Sasha , or even the footmen Rufus and Miles . His lack of English had not stopped him from making conquests of several of the Trask maids , if all she heard was correct . She had n't the heart to scold the girls since Petri 's master was busy weaving his spell around Penelope . <p> " Yes , " Penelope said to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " Please to come , " he said , bowing and gesturing to the sitting room . The chamber was mercifully empty , the guests still reveling at the fete . They would be for most of the night , Damien having promised a feast , a bonfire , and fireworks . <p> Petri waited patiently in the middle of the room . A tray with a coffeepot , cup , and honey waited on a table , as though he 'd prepared carefully for this conversation . <p> The enigmatic valet complemented Damien well . They were the same age and possessed roughly the same looks . Petri had black hair , clear blue eyes , and a brutal handsomeness that was wreaking havoc below stairs . Damien had the same brutal handsomeness , but one controlled and contained , like a honed sword , to serve his needs . <p> Petri 's attractiveness was unstudied and raw . He had no need to be cultivated , unlike his master . <p> He gestured Penelope to a chair , and she sat . Like the good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then carefully poured coffee and added the exact amount of honey Penelope liked . <p> " Thank you . " She accepted the cup and sipped . He nodded and gave a grunt , as though he did not know the words for " you 're welcome . " She politely gestured to the chair facing her , but he refused it , and stood , his hands behind his back in a military stance . " My English , " he said , " is not so good , I am sorry . " <p> " That is all right , " Penelope said . " Take your time . " Petri studied her coffee cup and then the tray , then drew a breath as though what he had to say would condemn him , but he had to say it anyway . <p> " You marry Damien , yes ?

Behind the table where the five members of the king 's small council were seated , the Iron Throne crouched like some great black beast , its barbs and claws and blades half-shrouded in shadow . Kevan Lannister could feel it at his back , an itch between the shoulder blades . It was easy to imagine old King Aerys perched up there , bleeding from some fresh cut , glowering down . But today the throne was empty . He had seen no reason for Tommen to join them . Kinder to let the boy remain with his mother . The Seven only knew how long mother and son might have together before Cersei 's trial and possibly her execution . <p> Mace Tyrell was speaking .

However loud his protestations , the Knight of Griffin 's Roost remained suspect . Supposedly the sellswords who had landed in the south were being led by one of his own blood . <p> As the echoes of Connington 's footsteps faded away , Grand Maester Pycelle gave a ponderous shake of his head . " His uncle once stood just where the boy was standing now and told King Aerys how he would deliver him the head of Robert Baratheon . " <p> That is how it is when a man grows as old as Pycelle .

" Black cloaks would suit them , I agree . I will not suffer such men in the city watch . " A hundred of his own Highgarden men had been added to the gold cloaks , yet plainly his lordship meant to resist any balancing infusion of westermen . The more I give him , the more he wants .

" <p> How can you recapture it when you have never captured it to begin with ? " I understand , my lord , but " <p> Tyrell did not let him finish .

" Stannis in the north , ironmen in the west , sellswords in the south . Defy the High Septon , and we will have blood running in the gutters of King 's Landing as well . If we are seen to be going against the gods , it will only drive the pious into the arms of one or the other of these would-be usurpers . " <p> Mace Tyrell remained unmoved . " Once Paxter Redwyne sweeps the ironmen from the seas , my sons will retake the Shields . The snows will do for Stannis , or Bolton will . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Lord Randyll said . " as for Connington , " Tyrell repeated , " what victories has he ever won that we should fear him ? He could have ended Robert 's Rebellion at Stoney Sept . He failed . Just as the Golden Company has always failed . Some may rush to join them , aye . The realm is well rid of such fools . " <p> Ser Kevan wished that he could share his certainty . He had known Jon Connington , slightlya proud youth , the most headstrong of the gaggle of young lordlings who had gathered around Prince Rhaegar Targaryen , competing for his royal favor . Arrogant , but able and energetic . That , and his skill at arms , was why Mad King Aerys had named him Hand . Old Lord Merryweather 's inaction had allowed the rebellion to take root and spread , and Aerys wanted someone young and vigorous to match Robert 's own youth and vigor . " Too soon , " Lord Tywin Lannister had declared when word of the king 's choice had reached Casterly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too eager for glory . " <p> The Battle of the Bells had proved the truth of that . Ser Kevan had expected that afterward Aerys would have no choice but to summon Tywin once more but the Mad King had turned to the Lords Chelsted and Rossart instead , and paid for it with life and crown . That was all so long ago , though . If this is indeed Jon Connington , he will be a different man . Older , harder , more seasoned more dangerous . " Connington may have more than the Golden Company . It is said he has a Targaryen pretender . " <p> " A feigned boy is what he has , " said Randyll Tarly . " That may be . Or not . " Kevan Lannister had been here , in this very hall when Tywin had laid the bodies of Prince Rhaegar 's children at the foot of the Iron Throne , wrapped up in crimson cloaks . The girl had been recognizably the Princess Rhaenys , but the boy a faceless horror of bone and brain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ None of us looked long . Tywin said that it was Prince Aegon , and we took him at his word . " We have these tales coming from the east as well . A second Targaryen , and one whose blood no man can question .

" Mad she may be , " Ser Kevan said , " but with so much smoke drifting west , surely there must be some fire burning in the east . " <p> Grand Maester Pycelle bobbed his head . " Dragons . These same stories have reached Oldtown . Too many to discount . A silver-haired queen with three dragons . " <p> " At the far end of the world , " said Mace Tyrell .

" <p> Mace Tyrell crossed his arms . " I mean to do just that , ser . After the trials . " <p> " Aye , if we had gold , " Ser Harys Swyft said . " Alas , my lords , our vaults contain only rats and roaches . I have written again to the Myrish bankers . If they will agree to make good the crown 's debt to the Braavosi and extend us a new loan , mayhaps we will not have to raise the taxes .

Unless a new source of coin could be found , or the Iron Bank persuaded to relent , he would have no choice but to pay the crown 's debts with Lannister gold .

Half the lords in the realm could not tell taxation from tyranny , and would bolt to the nearest usurper in a heartbeat if it would save them a clipped copper . " If that fails , you may well need to go to Braavos , to treat with the Iron Bank yourself . " <p> Ser Harys quailed . " Must I ? " <p> " You are the master of coin , " Lord Randyll said sharply . " I am . " <p> The puff of white hair at the end of Swyft 's chin quivered in outrage . <p> " Must I remind my lord , this trouble is not of my doing ?

" No wealth was found on Dragonstone , I promise you . My son 's men have searched every inch of that damp and dreary island and turned up not so much as a single gemstone or speck of gold . Nor any sign of this fabled hoard of dragon eggs . " <p> Kevan Lannister had seen Dragonstone with his own eyes . He doubted very much that Loras Tyrell had searched every inch of that ancient stronghold . The Valyrians had raised it , after all , and all their works stank of sorcery . And Ser Loras was young , prone to all the rash judgments of youth , and had been grievously wounded storming the castle besides . But it would not do to remind Tyrell that his favorite son was fallible . " If there was wealth on Dragonstone , Stannis would have found it , " he declared . <p> " Let us move along , my lords .

He does not speak , he will not show his face , he is never seen without his armor . Do we know for a certainty that he is even a knight ? " <p> We do not even know if he ' s alive . Meryn Trant claimed that Strong took neither food nor drink , and Boros Blount went so far as to say he had never seen the man use the privy . Why should he ? Dead men do not shit . Kevan Lannister had a strong suspicion of just who this Ser Robert really was beneath that gleaming white armor . A suspicion that Mace Tyrell and Randyll Tarly no doubt shared . Whatever the face hidden behind Strong 's helm , it must remain hidden for now . The silent giant was his niece 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he appears . But Mace Tyrell could not seem to see beyond the threat to his own daughter . " His Grace named Ser Robert to the Kingsguard , " Ser Kevan reminded him , " and Qyburn vouches for the man as well . Be that as it may , we need Ser Robert to prevail , my lords . If my niece is proved guilty of these treasons , the legitimacy of her children will be called into question . If Tommen ceases to be a king , Margaery will cease to be a queen . " He let Tyrell chew on that a moment . " Whatever Cersei may have done , she is still a daughter of the Rock , of mine own blood . I will not let her die a traitor 's death , but I have made sure to draw her fangs . All her guards have been dismissed and replaced with my own men . In place of her former ladies-in-waiting , she will henceforth be attended by a septa and three novices selected by the High Septon . She is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realm , nor in Tommen 's education . I mean to return her to Casterly Rock after the trial and see that she remains there . Let that suffice . " <p> The rest he left unsaid . Cersei was soiled goods now , her power at an end . Every baker 's boy and beggar in the city had seen her in her shame and every tart and tanner from Flea Bottom to Pisswater Bend had gazed upon her nakedness , their eager eyes crawling over her breasts and belly and woman 's parts . No queen could expect to rule again after that . In gold and silk and emeralds Cersei had been a queen , the next thing to a goddess ; naked , she was only human , an aging woman with stretch marks on her belly and teats that had begun to sag as the shrews in the crowds had been glad to point out to their husbands and lovers .

" Soon , I hope , " he said instead , before turning to Grand Maester Pycelle . " Is there aught else ? " <p> The Grand Maester consulted his papers . " We should address the Rosby inheritance . Six claims have been put forth " <p> " We can settle Rosby at some later date . What else ? " <p> " Preparations should be made for Princess Myrcella .

Once Redwyne returned to King 's Landing , the council would stand at three and three , Lannister and Tyrell . <p> The seventh voice would be the Dornishwoman now escorting <p> Myrcella home . The Lady Nym . But no lady , if even half of what Qyburn reports is true . A bastard daughter of the Red Viper , near as notorious as her father and intent on claiming the council seat that Prince Oberyn himself had occupied so briefly .

" He yanked his gloves on and set off across the yard , leaning hard into the wind as his cloak snapped and swirled behind him . <p> The dry moat surrounding Maegor 's Holdfast was three feet deep in snow , the iron spikes that lined it glistening with frost . The only way in or out of Maegor 's was across the drawbridge that spanned that moat . A knight of the Kingsguard was always posted at its far end . Tonight the duty had fallen to Ser Meryn Trant . With Balon Swann hunting the rogue knight Darkstar down in Dorne , Loras Tyrell gravely wounded on Dragon-stone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the White Swords remained in King 's Landing , and Ser Kevan had thrown Osmund Kettleblack ( and his brother Osfryd ) into the dungeon within hours of Cersei 's confessing that she had taken both men as lovers . That left only Trant , the feeble Boros Blount , and Qyburn 's mute monster Robert Strong to protect the young king and royal family . <p> I will need to find some new swords for the Kingsguard . Tommen should have seven good knights about him . In the past the Kingsguard had served for life , but that had not stopped Joffrey from dismissing Ser Barristan Selmy to make a place for his dog , Sandor Clegane . Kevan could make use of that precedent . I could put Lancel in a white cloak , he reflected . There is more honor in that than he will ever find in the Warrior ' s Sons . Kevan Lannister hung his snow-sodden cloak inside his solar , pulled off his boots , and commanded his serving man to fetch some fresh wood for his fire . " A cup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said as he settled by the hearth . " See to it . " <p> The fire soon thawed him , and the wine warmed his insides nicely . It also made him sleepy , so he dare not drink another cup . His day was far from done . He had reports to read , letters to write . And supper with Cersei and the king . His niece had been subdued and submissive since her walk of atonement , thank the gods . The novices who attended her reported that she spent a third of her waking hours with her son , another third in prayer , and the rest in her tub . She was bathing four or five times a day , scrubbing herself with horsehair brushes and strong lye soap , as if she meant to scrape her skin off . <p> She will never wash the stain away , no matter how hard she scrubs . Ser Kevan remembered the girl she once had been , so full of life and mischief . And when she 'd flowered , ahhhh had there ever been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had agreed to marry her to Rhaegar , how many deaths might have been avoided ? Cersei could have given the prince the sons he wanted , lions with purple eyes and silver manes and with such a wife , Rhaegar might never have looked twice at Lyanna Stark . The northern girl had a wild beauty , as he recalled , though however bright a torch might burn it could never match the rising sun . <p> But it did no good to brood on lost battles and roads not taken . That was a vice of old done men . Rhaegar had wed Elia of Dorne , Lyanna Stark had died , Robert Baratheon had taken Cersei to bride , and here they were . And tonight his own road would take him to his niece 's chambers and face-to-face with Cersei . <p> I have no reason to feel guilty , Ser Kevan told himself . Tywin would understand that , surely . It was his daughter who brought shame down on our name , not I. What I did I did for the good of House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never done the same . In their father 's final years , after their mother 's passing , their sire had taken the comely daughter of a candlemaker as mistress . It was not unknown for a widowed lord to keep a common girl as bedwarmer but Lord Tytos soon began seating the woman beside him in the hall , showering her with gifts and honors , even asking her views on matters of state . Within a year she was dismissing servants , ordering about his household knights , even speaking for his lordship when he was indisposed . She grew so influential that it was said about Lannisport that any man who wished for his petition to be heard should kneel before her and speak loudly to her lap for Tytos Lannister ' <p> s ear was between his lady 's legs . She had even taken to wearing their mother 's jewels . <p> Until the day their lord father 's heart had burst in his chest as he was ascending a steep flight of steps to her bed , that is . All the self-seekers who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abandoned her quickly enough when Tywin had her stripped naked and paraded through Lannisport to the docks , like a common whore . Though no man laid a hand on her , that walk spelled the end of her power . Surely Tywin would never have dreamed that same fate awaited his own golden daughter . <p> " It had to be , " Ser Kevan muttered over the last of his wine . His High Holiness had to be appeased . Tommen needed the Faith behind him in the battles to come . And Cersei the golden child had grown into a vain , foolish , greedy woman . Left to rule , she would have ruined Tommen as she had Joffrey . <p> Outside the wind was rising , clawing at the shutters of his chamber . Ser Kevan pushed himself to his feet . Time to face the lioness in her den . We have pulled her claws . Jaime , though But no , he would not brood on that . <p> He donned an old , well-worn doublet , in case his niece had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he left his sword belt hanging on the back of his chair . Only the knights of the Kingsguard were permitted swords in Tommen 's presence . <p> Ser Boros Blount was in attendance on the boy king and his mother when Ser Kevan entered the royal chambers . Blount wore enameled scale , white cloak , and halfhelm . He did not look well . Of late Boros had grown notably heavier about the face and belly , and his color was not good . And he was leaning against the wall behind him , as if standing had become too great an effort for him . <p> The meal was served by three novices , well-scrubbed girls of good birth between the ages of twelve and sixteen . In their soft white woolens , each seemed more innocent and unworldly than the last , yet the High Septon had insisted that no girl spend more than seven days in the queen 's service , lest Cersei corrupt her . They tended the queen 's wardrobe , drew her bath , poured her wine , changed her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed every night , to ascertain she had no other company ; the other two slept in an adjoining chamber with the septa who looked over them . A tall stork of a girl with a pockmarked face escorted him into the royal presence . Cersei rose when he entered and kissed him lightly on the cheek . " Dear uncle . It is so good of you to sup with us . " The queen was dressed as modestly as any matron , in a dark brown gown that buttoned up to her throat and a hooded green mantle that covered her shaved head . Before her walk she would have flaunted her baldness beneath a golden crown . " Come , sit , " she said . " Will you have wine ? " <p> " A cup . " He sat , still wary . <p> A freckled novice filled their cups with hot spiced wine . " Tommen tells me that Lord Tyrell intends to rebuild the Tower of the Hand , " Cersei said . <p> Ser Kevan nodded . " The new tower will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he says . " <p> That made him smile . It is good that she still remembers how to laugh . When he asked if she had all that she required , the queen said , " I am well served . The girls are sweet , and the good septas make certain that I say my prayers . But once my innocence is proved , it would please me if Taena Merryweather might attend me once again . She could bring her son to court . Tommen needs other boys about him , friends of noble birth . " <p> It was a modest request . Ser Kevan saw no reason why it should not be granted . He could foster the Merryweather boy himself , whilst Lady Taena accompanied Cersei back to Casterly Rock . " I will send for her after the trial , " he promised . <p> Supper began with beef-and-barley soup , followed by a brace of quail and a roast pike near three feet long , with turnips , mushrooms , and plenty of hot bread and butter . Ser Boros tasted every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duty for a knight of the Kingsguard , but perhaps all Blount was capable of these days and wise , after the way Tommen 's brother had died . <p> The king seemed happier than Kevan Lannister had seen him in a long time . From soup to sweet Tommen burbled about the exploits of his kittens , whilst feeding them morsels of pike off his own royal plate . " The bad cat was outside my window last night , " he informed Kevan at one point , " but Ser Pounce hissed at him and he ran off across the roofs . " <p> " The bad cat ? " Ser Kevan said , amused . He is a sweet boy . " An old black tomcat with a torn ear , " Cersei told him . " A filthy thing , and foul-tempered . He clawed Joff 's hand once . " She made a face . " The cats keep the rats down , I know , but that one he 's been known to attack ravens in the rookery . " <p> " I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ser Kevan could not remember ever seeing his niece so quiet , so subdued , so demure . All for the good , he supposed . But it made him sad as well . Her fire is quenched , she who used to burn so bright . " You have not asked about your brother , " he said , as they were waiting for the cream cakes . Cream cakes were the king 's favorite . <p> Cersei lifted her chin , her green eyes shining in the candlelight . <p> " Jaime ? Have you had word ? " <p> " None . Cersei , you may need to prepare yourself for " <p> " If he were dead , I would know it . We came into this world together , Uncle . He would not go without me . " She took a drink of wine . " Tyrion can leave whenever he wishes . You have had no word of him either , I suppose . " <p> " No one has tried to sell us a dwarf 's head of late , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ask you a question ? " <p> " Whatever you wish . " <p> " Your wife do you mean to bring her to court ? " <p> " No . " Dorna was a gentle soul , never comfortable but at home with friends and kin around her . She had done well by their children , dreamed of having grandchildren , prayed seven times a day , loved needlework and flowers . In King 's Landing she would be as happy as one of Tommen 's kittens in a pit of vipers . " My lady wife mislikes travel . Lannisport is her place . " <p> " It is a wise woman who knows her place . " <p> He did not like the sound of that . " Say what you mean . " <p> " I thought I did . " Cersei held out her cup . The freckled girl filled it once again . The cream cakes appeared then , and the conversation took a lighter turn . Only after Tommen and his kittens were escorted off to the royal bedchamber by Ser @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Osney 's brothers will not stand by idly and watch him die , " Cersei warned him . <p> " I did not expect that they would . I 've had the both of them arrested . " That seemed to take her aback . " For what crime ? " <p> " Fornication with a queen . His High Holiness says that you confessed to bedding both of themhad you forgotten ? " <p> Her face reddened . " No . What will you do with them ? " <p> " The Wall , if they admit their guilt . If they deny it , they can face Ser Robert . Such men should never have been raised so high . " <p> Cersei lowered her head . " I I misjudged them . " <p> " You misjudged a good many men , it seems . " <p> He might have said more , but the dark-haired novice with the round cheeks returned to say , " My lord , my lady , I am sorry to intrude , but there is a boy below @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Regent 's presence at once . " <p> Before he took his leave , he dropped to one knee and kissed his niece upon the hand . If her silent giant failed her , it might be the last kiss she would ever know . <p> The messenger was a boy of eight or nine , so bundled up in fur he seemed a bear cub . Trant had kept him waiting out on the drawbridge rather than admit him into Maegor 's . " Go find a fire , lad , " Ser Kevan told him , pressing a penny into his hand . " I know the way to the rookery well enough . " <p> The snow had finally stopped falling . Behind a veil of ragged clouds , a full moon floated fat and white as a snowball . The stars shone cold and distant . As Ser Kevan made his way across the inner ward , the castle seemed an alien place , where every keep and tower had grown icy teeth , and all familiar paths had vanished beneath a white blanket . Once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his feet . Autumn in King ' s Landing , he brooded . What must it be like up on the Wall ? <p> The door was opened by a serving girl , a skinny thing in a fur-lined robe much too big for her . Ser Kevan stamped the snow off his boots , removed his cloak , tossed it to her . " The Grand Maester is expecting me , " <p> he announced . The girl nodded , solemn and silent , and pointed to the steps . Pycelle 's chambers were beneath the rookery , a spacious suite of rooms cluttered with racks of herbs and salves and potions and shelves jammed full of books and scrolls . Ser Kevan had always found them uncomfortably hot . Not tonight . Once past the chamber door , the chill was palpable . Black ash and dying embers were all that remained of the hearthfire . A few flickering candles cast pools of dim light here and there . The rest was shrouded in shadow except beneath the open window , where a spray of ice crystals glittered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the window seat a raven loitered , pale , huge , its feathers ruffled . It was the largest raven that Kevan Lannister had ever seen . Larger than any hunting hawk at Casterly Rock , larger than the largest owl . Blowing snow danced around it , and the moon painted it silver . <p> Not silver . White . The bird is white . <p> The white ravens of the Citadel did not carry messages , as their dark cousins did . When they went forth from Oldtown , it was for one purpose only : to herald a change of seasons . <p> " Winter , " said Ser Kevan . The word made a white mist in the air . He turned away from the window . <p> Then something slammed him in the chest between the ribs , hard as a giant 's fist . It drove the breath from him and sent him lurching backwards . The white raven took to the air , its pale wings slapping him about the head . Ser Kevan half-sat and half-fell onto the window seat . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his chest . No . No , that was how my brother died . Blood was seeping out around the shaft . " Pycelle , " he muttered , confused . " Help me I " <p> Then he saw . Grand Maester Pycelle was seated at his table , his head pillowed on the great leather-bound tome before him . Sleeping , Kevan thought until he blinked and saw the deep red gash in the old man 's spotted skull and the blood pooled beneath his head , staining the pages of his book . All around his candle were bits of bone and brain , islands in a lake of melted wax . <p> He wanted guards , Ser Kevan thought . I should have sent him guards . Could Cersei have been right all along ? Was this his nephew 's work ? <p> " Tyrion ? " he called . " Where ? " <p> " Far away , " a half-familiar voice replied . <p> He stood in a pool of shadow by a bookcase , plump , pale-faced , round-shouldered , clutching a crossbow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Varys ? " <p> The eunuch set the crossbow down . " Ser Kevan . Forgive me if you can . I bear you no i 'll will . This was not done from malice . It was for the realm . For the children . " <p> I have children . I have a wife . Oh , Dorna . Pain washed over him . He closed his eyes , opened them again . " There are there are hundreds of Lannister guardsmen in this castle . " <p> " But none in this room , thankfully . This pains me , my lord . You do not deserve to die alone on such a cold dark night . There are many like you , good men in service to bad causes but you were threatening to undo all the queen ' <p> A gust of wind blew up . Ser Kevan shivered violently . " Are you cold , my lord ? " asked Varys . " Do forgive me . The Grand Maester befouled himself in dying , and the stink was so abominable that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to rise , but the strength had left him . He could not feel his legs . <p> " I thought the crossbow fitting . You shared so much with Lord Tywin , why not that ? Your niece will think the Tyrells had you murdered , mayhaps with the connivance of the Imp . The Tyrells will suspect her . Someone somewhere will find a way to blame the Dornishmen . Doubt , division , and mistrust will eat the very ground beneath your boy king , whilst Aegon raises his banner above Storm 's End and the lords of the realm gather round him . " <p> " Aegon ? " For a moment he did not understand . Then he <p> remembered . A babe swaddled in a crimson cloak , the cloth stained with his blood and brains . " Dead . He 's dead . " <p> " No . " The eunuch 's voice seemed deeper . " He is here . Aegon has been shaped for rule since before he could walk . He has been trained in arms , as befits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of his education . He reads and writes , he speaks several tongues , he has studied history and law and poetry . A septa has instructed him in the mysteries of the Faith since he was old enough to understand them . He has lived with fisherfolk , worked with his hands , swum in rivers and mended nets and learned to wash his own clothes at need . He can fish and cook and bind up a wound , he knows what it is like to be hungry , to be hunted , to be afraid . Tommen has been taught that kingship is his right . Aegon knows that kingship is his duty , that a king must put his people first , and live and rule for them . " <p> Kevan Lannister tried to cry out to his guards , his wife , his brother but the words would not come . Blood dribbled from his mouth . He shuddered violently . <p> " I am sorry . " Varys wrung his hands . " You are suffering , I know , yet here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Time to make an end to it . " The eunuch pursed his lips and gave a little whistle . Ser Kevan was cold as ice , and every labored breath sent a fresh stab of pain through him . He glimpsed movement , heard the soft scuffling sound of slippered feet on stone . A child emerged from a pool of darkness , a pale boy in a ragged robe , no more than nine or ten . Another rose up behind the Grand Maester 's chair . The girl who had opened the door for him was there as well . They were all around him , half a dozen of them , white-faced children with dark eyes , boys and girls together .

I got back in the Jetta , which by now had a pretty thick layer of snow coating it , and started the motor to let it warm up . While I was waiting I found a Pixies song I liked on my iPod and called my sister . <p> It took a few rings for her to answer , and when she did she sounded harried and out of breath . <p> " How was she ?

He knew them , not well , but well enough . He backed them , his companies supported them . His father would have betrayed them all as well as the sister that now lived among them . The sister Seth had never known he had , but loved anyway . <p> Callan Lyons , pride leader . He stood by the window , the late evening sunlight spearing through the heavy mane of hair that fell to his shoulders and cast his expression in shadow . Beside him was Seths brother-in-law , Taber Williams , who watched him with quiet anguish , a look in his eyes that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kane Tyler , brother-in-law to Callan Lyons and Sanctuarys head of security , was resigned , somber . And Jonas Wyatt , the arrogant , forceful enforcer who had been steadily moving up the ranks of Security , stood at a scarred desk . <p> " Is she okay ? " Seth asked the question , his voice gruff , fear squeezing his heart . Shewas Dawn . Dawn Daniels , the little Cougar Breed female that he could n't get out of his mind , that he could n't forget . She had been wounded when Seths chauffeur had attempted to kidnap a Breed child , Cassie Walker , and Seths half sister , Roni , months ago . <p> She was too tiny , too delicate to be as reckless and fearless as she was in battle . To be so haunted when touched by a man . <p> In the few glimpses he had managed of her in the past months , she had looked haunted . And Seth wanted nothing more than to wipe those dark shadows from her eyes . <p> " Then why am I here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stared them down . If they had brought him here to warn him away from Dawn , then they were wasting their time . Nothing , no one , could change the course he had set for himself . In all his life no one had belonged to him . He had n't  loved anyone since his mothers death , until Dawn . <p> " I wont be part of this . " Taber suddenly stiffened his shoulders and shook his dark head . The Jaguar Breed was tall , leanly powerful and obviously not in agreement with this meeting . <p> " Taber . " Callan kept his voice low . " None of us like it , but it has to be done . " <p> " Then let 's get to the damned point , " Seth demanded coldly , his voice sharp , brisk . " I 'll assume this is about Dawn ? " <p> Callan almost snarled . Taber jerked his head to the side and Kane rubbed at the back of his neck . <p> " Mr. Lawrence , weve only met briefly . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ features , stepped forward to lean against the front of the desk , a television remote control in his hand . <p> " I remember you , " Seth answered , his voice clipped . <p> " Dawn concerns us , " he said then , his voice gruff , arrogant . He was one of those men that other men naturally never get along with . They might respect him , might admire his power and cunning , but he was n't a man others could be comfortable around . <p> Seth knew the type . He was the same way . Control and power came with an innate arrogance that naturally did n't  fit well when it came in contact with those who were similar . <p> " Dawn concerns me as well , Mr. Wyatt , " Seth informed him .

" Tabers growl was more animal than man and had Seth tensing for action . Seth caught the other mans arm as he passed , ignoring the flash of dangerously sharp canines as Taber turned to him .

@@37756609 @6756609/ <p> Once there were four young ladies who sat at the side of every ball , soiree , and party during the London season . Waiting night after night in a row of chairs , the wallflowers eventually struck up a conversation . They realized that although they were in competition for the same group of gentlemen , there was more to be gained from being friends rather than adversaries . And even more than that , they liked one another . They decided to band together to find husbands , starting with the oldest , Annabelle , and working down to the youngest , Daisy . <p> Annabelle was unquestionably the most beautiful wallflower , but she was virtually penniless , which put her at the greatest disadvantage . Although most London bachelors hoped for a wife with a pretty face , they usually settled for one with a handsome dowry . <p> Evie was unconventionally attractive , with flaming hair and abundant freckles . It was well-known that someday she would inherit a fortune from her father . However , her father was a common-born ex-boxer who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a difficult obstacle for a young lady to surmount . Even worse , Evie was cripplingly shy and had a stammer . Any man who tried to talk to her would later describe the encounter as an act of torture . <p> Lillian and Daisy were sisters from New York . Their family , the Bowmans , were astonishingly , vulgarly , almost unimaginably wealthy , having made their fortune with a soap manufacturing business . They had no good blood , no manners , and no social patrons . Lillian was a fiercely loving friend , but also strong-willed and bossy . And Daisy was a dreamer who often fretted that real life was never quite as interesting as the novels she read so voraciously . <p> As the wallflowers helped one another navigate the perils of London society , and consoled and supported one another through very real dangers , sorrows , and joys , they each found a husband , and no one referred to them as wallflowers anymore . <p> In every social season , however , there was no shortage of new wallflowers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who were overlooked and ignored by gentlemen who really should have known better . ) <p> But then there was the Christmas when Rafe Bowman , Lillian and Daisys oldest brother , came to England . After that , life for one London wallflower would never be the same . <p> CHAPTER 1 <p> LONDON 1845 <p> Its official , " Lillian , Lady Westcliff , said with satisfaction , setting aside the letter from her brother . " Rafe will reach London in precisely a fortnight . And the clippers name is the Whirlwind , which I think is quite apt in light of his impending betrothal . " <p> She glanced down at Annabelle and Evie , who were both on the parlor floor working on a massive circle of red velvet . They had gathered at Lillians London house , Marsden Terrace , for an afternoon of tea and conversation . <p> At the moment Annabelle and Evie were making a tree skirt , or rather trying to salvage the fabric from Lillians previous efforts . Evie was snipping at a piece of brocade ribbon that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ busy cutting a new edge of fabric and pinning it . <p> The only one missing was Lillians younger sister Daisy , who lived in Bristol with her new husband . Annabelle longed to see Daisy and find out how marriage suited her . Thankfully they would all be together soon for the Christmas holiday in Hampshire . <p> " Do you think your brother will have any difficulty convincing Lady Natalie to marry him ? " Annabelle asked , frowning as she encountered a large , dark stain on the fabric . <p> " Oh , not at all , " Lillian said breezily . " He s handsome , charming , and very rich . What could Lady Natalie possibly object to , aside from the fact that he s an American ? " <p> " Well , Daisy said he s a rake . And some young women might not " <p> " Nonsense !

" <p> Annabelle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generally regarded as a dreamer and a romantic , she had a streak of clear-eyed pragmatism that made her judgments quite reliable . If Daisy had said their oldest brother was a rake , there was undoubtedly strong evidence to support the assertion . <p> " Does he drink and gamble ? " Annabelle asked Lillian . <p> A wary frown . " On occasion . " <p> " Does he behave in rude or improper ways ? " <p> " He s a Bowman . We do n't  know any better . " <p> " Does he pursue women ? " <p> " Of course . " <p> " Has he ever been faithful to one woman ? Has he ever fallen in love ? " <p> Lillian frowned at her . " Not that I 'm aware of . " <p> Annabelle glanced at Evie with raised brows . " What do you think , Evie ? " <p> " Rake , " came the succinct reply . <p> " Oh , all right , " Lillian grumbled . " I suppose he is a rake . But that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Natalie . Some women like rakes . Look at Evie . " <p> Evie continued to snip doggedly through the brocade ribbon , while a smile curved her lips . " I do n't  l-like all rakes , " she said , her gaze on her work . " Just one . " <p> Evie , the gentlest and most soft-spoken of them all , had been the one least likely to capture the heart of the notorious Lord St. Vincent , who had been the definitive rake . Although Evie , with her round blue eyes and blazing red hair , possessed a rare and unconventional beauty , she was unbearably shy . And there was the stammer . But Evie also had a reserve of quiet strength and a gallant spirit that seemed to have seduced her husband utterly .

There was no way for it to dissipate easily . The sound ricocheted from wall to wall and from ceiling to floor before making the return trip to blend with the continued agonizing sounds . <p> Surrounding the theater-style examination/operation room were twelve eight-by-ten cells created from steel and iron bars . The cells ran the entire length of the steel wall at one side and were connected by frames of black iron bars at the front . <p> The barred doors were reinforced ; the locks were digital as well as electronically keyed and almost impossible to crack unless total power , including that of the backup generators , was lost .

Inconsolable wails that had left those locked behind the bars fighting the restless rage beginning to fill them . They had even seemed to affect the guards created to rule over them . Men , animals , whose eyes held no mercy but who now seemed to glance at one another in uncomfortable silence as the time of death grew closer . As the imprisoned creations watching them seemed to grow more still , more calm and silent than ever before . <p> They were her young , of a sort . <p> Conception had occurred in the artificial environment of a lab before the fertilized egg was transplanted into her womb and carried to term .

Once she was restrained , then the child was cut from her body as she screamed in agony . <p> Unable to move . <p> Unable to fight . <p> Unable to control any part of her body except the vocal cords that the scientists refused to silence . <p> She would scream until her voice broke and then only silent animalistic growls would emerge from her throat . <p> But she was n't an animal . She was n't even a half animal as her young were . She was a young woman who had forgotten what gentleness and freedom were . She knew only the captivity , the pain , the endless pregnancies and forced births . <p> And now she would only know the agony and fear of a senseless , vicious death , which her young were forced to watch in uncaring silence . <p> Breed number 107 sat on his cot in the corner of the cell , his head laid back against the steel bars as his mothers terror-filled sobs echoed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one he called brother , the one they called 108 , were only a few of the young in the lab that were products of her genetics .

As though they werent ripping through their souls and tearing their guts to ribbons each time she begged , each time she screamed in agony . <p> Each time she begged God for mercy . <p> Breed number 107 kept his eyes closed , his breathing regulated , and called upon fourteen years of training to maintain the control needed to restrain his rage and pain .

As though they could n't sate their hunger for the blood , screams and agony forced upon the Breeds .

Because , strangely , in an act so out of character for a Coyote , Elder had attempted to slip the woman from the labs and to shut down the generators that kept the scientists creations caged and under control . <p> Elder had failed , though . Hed been betrayed by one of the twelve who now sat silently in the cells as their dams voice began to rise in horror . <p> Breed number 107 wondered if this would be the final horror that would break the only female in the group .

The Second Sons are not unlike a family " <p> " and every family has its drooling cousins . " Tyrion signed another note . The parchment crinkled crisply as he slid it toward the paymaster . " There are cells down in the bowels of Casterly Rock where my lord father kept the worst of ours . " He dipped his quill in the inkpot . Tyrion of House Lannister , he scratched out , promising to pay the bearer of the note one hundred golden dragons . Every stroke of the quill leaves me a little poorer or would , if I were not a beggar to begin with . One day he might rue these signatures . But not this day . He blew on the wet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signed the one beneath . And again . And again . And again . " This wounds me deeply , I will have you know , " he told them between signatures . " In Westeros , the word of a Lannister is considered good as gold . " <p> Inkpots shrugged . " This is not Westeros . On this side of the narrow sea , we put our promises on paper . " As each sheet was passed to him , he scattered fine sand across the signature to drink up excess ink , shook it off , and set the note aside . " Debts written on the wind tend to be forgotten , shall we say ? " <p> " Not by us . " Tyrion signed another sheet . And another . He had found a rhythm now . " A Lannister always pays his debts . " <p> Plumm chuckled . " Aye , but a sellsword 's word is worthless . " <p> Well , yours is , thought Tyrion , and thank the gods for that . " True , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book . " <p> " Soon enough , " said Brown Ben . " After the notes . " <p> " I am dancing as fast as I can . " He wanted to laugh , but that would have ruined the game . Plumm was enjoying this , and Tyrion had no intention of spoiling his fun . Let him go on thinking that he ' s bent me over and fucked me up the arse , and I ' ll go on buying steel swords with parchment dragons . If ever he went back to Westeros to claim his birthright , he would have all the gold of Casterly Rock to make good on his promises . If not , well , he 'd be dead , and his new brothers could wipe their arses with these parchments . Perhaps some might turn up in King 's Landing with their scraps in hand , hoping to convince his sweet sister to make good on them . And would that I could be a roach in the rushes to witness that . The writing on the parchments changed about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for serjeants . Below them the amounts suddenly grew larger . Now Tyrion was promising to pay the bearer one thousand golden dragons . He shook his head , laughed , signed . And again . And again . " So , " he said as he was scrawling , " what will be my duties with the company ? " <p> " You are too ugly to be Bokkoko 's butt boy , " said Kasporio , " but you might do as arrow fodder . " <p> " Better than you know , " said Tyrion , refusing to rise to the bait . " A small man with a big shield will drive the archers mad . A wiser man than you once told me that . " <p> " You will work with Inkpots , " said Brown Ben Plumm . " You will work for Inkpots , " said Inkpots . " Keeping books , counting coin , writing contracts and letters . " <p> " Gladly , " said Tyrion . " I love books . " <p> " What else would you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You are not fit to fight . " <p> " I once had charge of all the drains in Casterly Rock , " Tyrion said mildly . " Some of them had been stopped up for years , but I soon had them draining merrily away . " He dipped the quill in the ink again . Another dozen notes , and he would be done . " Perhaps I could supervise your camp followers . We ca n't have the men stopped up , now can we ? " <p> That jape did not please Brown Ben . " Stay away from the whores , " <p> he warned . " Most o ' them are poxy , and they talk . You 're not the first escaped slave to join the company , but that do n't mean we need to shout your presence . I wo n't have you parading about where you might be seen . Stay inside as much as you can , and shit into your bucket . Too many eyes at the latrines . And never go beyond our camp without my leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pretend you 're Jorah 's butt boy , but there 's some will see right through that . Once Meereen is taken and we 're away to Westeros , you can prance about all you like in gold and crimson . Till then , though " <p> " I shall live beneath a rock and never make a sound . You have my word on that . " Tyrion of House Lannister , he signed once more , with a flourish . That was the last parchment . Three notes remained , different from the rest . Two were written on fine vellum and made out by name . For Kasporio the Cunning , ten thousand dragons . The same for Inkpots , whose true name appeared to be Tybero Istarion . " Tybero ? " said Tyrion . " That sounds almost Lannister . Are you some long-lost cousin ? " <p> " Perhaps . I always pay my debts as well . It is expected of a paymaster . Sign . " <p> He signed . <p> Brown Ben 's note was the last . That one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand golden dragons , fifty hides of fertile land , a castle , and a lordship . Well and well . This Plumm does not come cheaply . Tyrion plucked at his scar and wondered if he ought to make a show of indignation . When you bugger a man you expect a squeal or two . He could curse and swear and rant of robbery , refuse to sign for a time , then give in reluctantly , protesting all the while . But he was sick of mummery , so instead he grimaced , signed , and handed the scroll back to Brown Ben . <p> " Your cock is as big as in the stories , " he said . " Consider me well and truly fucked , Lord Plumm . " <p> Brown Ben blew on his signature . " My pleasure , Imp . And now , we make you one o ' us . Inkpots , fetch the book . " <p> The book was leather-bound with iron hinges , and large enough to eat your supper off . Inside its heavy wooden boards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The Second Sons are amongst the oldest of the free companies , " Inkpots said as he was turning pages . " This is the fourth book . The names of every man to serve with us are written here . When they joined , where they fought , how long they served , the manner of their deathsall in the book . You will find famous names in here , some from your Seven Kingdoms . Aegor Rivers served a year with us , before he left to found the Golden Company . Bittersteel , you call him . The Bright Prince , Aerion Targaryen , he was a Second Son . And Rodrik Stark , the Wandering Wolf , him as well . No , not that ink . Here , use this . " He unstoppered a new pot and set it down . <p> Tyrion cocked his head . " Red ink ? " <p> " A tradition of the company , " Inkpots explained . " There was a time when each new man wrote his name in his own blood , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Lannisters love tradition . Lend me your knife . " <p> Inkpots raised an eyebrow , shrugged , slipped his dagger from its sheath , and handed it across hiltfirst . It still hurts , Halfmaester , thank you very much , thought Tyrion , as he pricked the ball of his thumb . He squeezed a fat drop of blood into the inkpot , traded the dagger for a fresh quill , and scrawled , Tyrion of House Lannister , Lord of Casterly <p> And it ' s done . The dwarf rocked back on the camp stool . " Is that all that you require of me ? Do n't I need to swear an oath ? Kill a baby ? Suck the captain 's cock ? " <p> " Suck whatever you like . " Inkpots turned the book around and dusted the page with a bit of fine sand . " For most of us , the signature suffices , but I would hate to disappoint a new brother-in-arms . Welcome to the Second Sons , Lord Tyrion . " <p> Lord Tyrion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sons might not enjoy the shining reputation of the Golden Company , but they had won some famous victories over the centuries . " Have other lords served with the company ? " <p> " Landless lords , " said Brown Ben . " Like you , Imp . " <p> Tyrion hopped down from the stool . " My previous brother was entirely unsatisfactory . I hope for more from my new ones . Now how do I go about securing arms and armor ? " <p> " Will you want a pig to ride as well ? " asked Kasporio . " Why , I did not know your wife was in the company , " <p> said Tyrion . <p> " That 's kind of you <p> to offer her , but I would prefer a horse . " <p> The bravo reddened , but Inkpots laughed aloud and Brown Ben went so far as to chuckle . " Inkpots , show him to the wagons . He can have his pick from the company steel . The girl too . Put a helm on her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take her for a boy . " <p> " Lord Tyrion , with me . " Inkpots held the tent flap to let him waddle through . " I will have Snatch take you to the wagons . Get your woman and meet him by the cook tent . " <p> " She is not my woman . Perhaps you should get her . All she does of late is sleep and glare at me . " <p> " You need to beat her harder and fuck her more often , " the paymaster offered helpfully . " Bring her , leave her , do what you will . Snatch will not care . Come find me when you have your armor , and I will start you on the ledgers . " <p> " As you wish . " <p> Tyrion found Penny asleep in a corner of their tent , curled up on a thin straw pallet beneath a heap of soiled bedclothes . When he touched her with the toe of his boot , she rolled over , blinked at him , and yawned . " Hugor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , are we ? " It was better than her usual sullen silence . All over an abandoned dog and pig . I saved the two of us from slavery , you would think some gratitude might be in order . " If you sleep any longer , you 're like to miss the war . " <p> " I 'm sad . " She yawned again . " And tired . So tired . " <p> Tired or sick ? Tyrion knelt beside her pallet . " You look pale . " He felt her brow . Is it hot in here , or does she have a touch of fever ? He dared not ask that question aloud . Even hard men like the Second Sons were terrified of mounting the pale mare . If they thought Penny was sick , they would drive her off without a moment 's hesitation . They might even return us to Yezzan ' s heirs , notes or no notes . " I have signed their book . The old way , in blood . I am now a Second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep from her eyes . " What about me ? Can I sign too ? " <p> " I think not . Some free companies have been known to take women , but well , they are not Second Daughters , after all . " <p> " We , " she said . " If you 're one of them , you should say we , not they . Has anyone seen Pretty Pig ? Inkpots said he 'd ask after her . Or Crunch , has there been word of Crunch ? " <p> Only if you trust Kasporio . Plumm 's not-so-cunning second-in-command claimed that three Yunkish slave-catchers were prowling through the camps , asking after a pair of escaped dwarfs . One of them was carrying a tall spear with a dog 's head impaled upon its point , the way that Kaspo told it . Such tidings were not like to get Penny out of bed , however . " No word as yet , " he lied . " Come . We need to find some armor for you . " <p> She gave him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Something my old master-at-arms told me . Never go to battle naked , lad , ' he said . I take him at his word . Besides , now that I 'm a sellsword , I really ought to have a sword to sell . " She still showed no signs of moving . Tyrion seized her by the wrist , pulled her to her feet , and threw a fistful of clothing into her face . " Dress . Wear the cloak with the hood and keep your head down . We ' <p> re supposed to be a pair of likely lads , just in case <p> the slave-catchers are watching . " <p> Snatch was waiting by the cook tent chewing sourleaf when the two dwarfs turned up , cloaked and hooded . " I hear the two o ' you are going to fight for us , " the serjeant said . " That should have them pissing in Meereen . Either o ' you ever killed a man ? " <p> Snatch scratched at his stubble with the point of his hook . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you kill with that ? " <p> " Nine . " His father counted for at least that many , surely . Lord of Casterly Rock , Warden of the West , Shield of Lannisport , Hand of the King , husband , brother , father , father , father . <p> " Nine . " Snatch snorted and spat out a mouthful of red slime . Aiming for Tyrion 's feet , perhaps , but it landed on his knee . Plainly that was what he thought of " nine . " The serjeant 's fingers were stained a mottled red from the juice of the sourleaf he chewed . He put two of them into his mouth and whistled . " Kem ! Get over here , you fucking pisspot . " <p> Kem came running . " Take Lord and Lady Imp to the wagons , have Hammer fix them up with some company steel . " <p> " Hammer might be passed-out drunk , " Kem cautioned . " Piss in his face . That 'll wake him up . " Snatch turned back to Tyrion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before , but boys we never lacked for . Sons o ' <p> this whore or that one , little fools run off from home to have adventures , butt boys , squires , and the like . Some o ' their shit might be small enough to fit imps . It 's the shit they were wearing when they died , like as not , but I know that wo n't bother fuckers fierce as you two . Nine , was it ? " He shook his head and walked away . <p> The Second Sons kept their company armor in six big wayns drawn up near the center of their camp . Kem led the way , swinging his spear as if it were a staff . " How does a King 's Landing lad end up with a free company ? " Tyrion asked him . <p> The lad gave him a wary squint . " Who told you I was from King 's Landing ? " <p> " No one . " Every word out of your mouth reeks of Flea Bottom . <p> " Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a Kingslander , they say . " <p> That seemed to startle him . " Who says that ? " <p> " Everyone . " Me . " Since when ? " <p> Since I just made it up . " For ages , " he lied . " My father was wont to say it . Did you know Lord Tywin , Kem ? " <p> " The Hand . Once I saw him riding up the hill . His men had red cloaks and little lions on their helms . I liked those helms . " His mouth tightened . " I never liked the Hand , though . He sacked the city . And then he smashed us on the Blackwater . " <p> " You were there ? " <p> " With Stannis . Lord Tywin come up with Renly 's ghost and took us in the flank . I dropped my spear and ran , but at the ships this bloody knight said , Where 's your spear , boy ? We got no room for cravens , ' and they buggered off and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard how your father was sending them as fought with Stannis to the Wall , so I made my way across the narrow sea and joined up with the Second Sons . " <p> " Do you miss King 's Landing ? " <p> " Some . I miss this boy , he he was a friend of mine . And my brother , Kennet , but he died on the bridge of ships . " <p> " Too many good men died that day . " Tyrion 's scar was itching fiercely . He picked at it with a fingernail . <p> " I miss the food too , " Kem said wistfully . " Your mother 's cooking ? " <p> " Rats would n't eat my mother 's cooking . There was this pot shop , though . No one ever made a bowl o ' brown like them . So thick you could stand your spoon up in the bowl , with chunks of this and that . You ever have yourself a bowl o ' brown , Halfman ? " <p> " A time or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " Why 's that ? " <p> " It tastes so good it makes me want to sing . " <p> Kem liked that . " Singer 's stew . I 'll ask for that next time I get back to Flea Bottom . What do you miss , Halfman ? " <p> Jaime , thought Tyrion . Shae . Tysha . My wife , I miss my wife , the wife I hardly knew . " Wine , whores , and wealth , " he answered . " Especially the wealth . Wealth will buy you wine and whores . " It will also buy you swords , and the Kems to wield them . <p> " Is it true the chamber pots in Casterly Rock are made of solid gold ? " Kem asked him . <p> " You should not believe everything you hear . Especially where House Lannister is concerned . " <p> " They say all Lannisters are twisty snakes . " <p> " Snakes ? " Tyrion laughed . " That sound you hear is my lord father , slithering in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say . But it makes no matter , Kem . Step on a snake or a lion 's tail , you 'll end up just as dead . " <p> By then they had reached the armory , such as it was . The smith , this fabled Hammer , proved to be a freakish-looking hulk with a left arm that appeared twice as thick as his right . " He ' <p> s drunk more than not , " <p> Kem said . <p> " Brown Ben let 's it go , but one day we 'll get us a real armorer . " Hammer ' <p> mused Tyrion . Hammer was sleeping off a drunk when they reached the forge , just as Kem had prophesied , but Nail had no objection to the two dwarfs clambering through the wagons . " Crap iron , most of it , " he warned them , " but you 're welcome to anything you can use . " <p> Under roofs of bent wood and stiffened leather , the wagon beds were heaped high with old weaponry and armor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ racks of swords and spears and halberds in the armory of the Lannisters below Casterly Rock . " This may take a while , " <p> he <p> declared . <p> " There 's sound steel here if you can find it , " a deep voice growled . <p> " None of it is pretty , but it will stop a sword . " <p> A big knight stepped down from the back of a wagon , clad head to heel in company steel . His left greave did not match his right , his gorget was spotted with rust , his vambraces rich and ornate , inlaid with niello flowers . On his right hand was a gauntlet of lobstered steel , on his left a fingerless mitt of rusted mail . The nipples on his muscled breastplate had a pair of iron rings through them . His greathelm sported a ram 's horns , one of which was broken . <p> When he took it off , he revealed the battered face of Jorah Mormont . He looks every inch a sellsword and not at all like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Tyrion reflected . His bruises had mostly faded by now , and the swelling in his face had largely subsided , so Mormont looked almost human once again though only vaguely like himself . The demon 's mask the slavers had burned into his right cheek to mark him for a dangerous and disobedient slave would never leave him . Ser Jorah had never been what one might call a comely man . The brand had transformed his face into something frightening . <p> Tyrion grinned . <p> " As long as I look prettier than you , I will be happy . " <p> He turned to Penny . " You take that wagon . I 'll start with this one . " <p> " It will go faster if we look together . " She plucked up a rusted iron half-helm , giggled , and stuck it on her head . " Do I look fearsome ? " <p> You look like a mummer girl with a pot on her head . " That 's a halfhelm . You want a greathelm . " He found one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's too big . " Penny 's voice echoed hollowly inside the steel . " I ca n't see out . " She took the helm off and flung it aside . " What 's wrong with the halfhelm ? " <p> " It 's open-faced . " Tyrion pinched her nose . " I am fond of looking at your nose . I would rather that you kept it . " <p> Her eyes got big . " You like my nose ? " <p> Oh , Seven save me . Tyrion turned away and began rooting amongst some piles of old armor toward the back of the wagon . <p> " Are there any other parts of me you like ? " Penny asked . <p> Perhaps she meant that to sound playful . It sounded sad instead . " I am fond of all of your parts , " Tyrion said , in hopes of ending any further discussion of the subject , " and even fonder of mine own . " <p> " Why should we need armor ? We 're only mummers . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretend very well , " said Tyrion , examining a shirt of heavy iron mail so full of holes that it almost looked moth-eaten . What sort of moths eat chainmail ? " Pretending to be dead is one way to survive a battle . Good armor is another . " Though there is precious little of that here , I fear . At the Green Fork , he had fought in mismatched scraps of plate from Lord Lefford 's wagons , with a spiked bucket helm that made it look as if someone had upended a slops pail over his head . This company steel was worse . Not just old and i 'll fitting , but dinted , cracked , and brittle . Is that dried blood , or only rust ? He sniffed at it but still could not be sure . <p> " Here 's a crossbow . " Penny showed it to him . <p> Tyrion glanced at it . " I can not use a stirrup winch . My legs are not long enough . A crank would serve me better . " Though , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crossbow . They took too long to reload . Even if he lurked by the latrine ditch waiting for some enemy to take a squat , the chances of his losing more than one quarrel would not be good . <p> Instead he picked up a morningstar , gave it a swing , put it down again . Too heavy . He passed over a warhammer ( too long ) , a studded mace ( also too heavy ) , and half a dozen longswords before he found a dirk he liked , a nasty piece of steel with a triangular blade . " This might serve , " he said . The blade had a bit of rust on it , but that would only make it nastier . He found a wood-and-leather sheath that fit and slipped the dirk inside . <p> " A little sword for a little man ? " joked Penny . " It 's a dirk and made for a big man . " Tyrion showed her an old long-sword . " This is a sword . Try it . " <p> Penny took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " Steel weighs more than wood . Chop through a man 's neck with that thing , though , and his head is not like to turn into a melon . " <p> He took the <p> sword back from her and inspected it more closely . " Cheap steel . And notched . Here , see ? I take back what I said . You need a better blade to hack off heads . " <p> Penny looked as though she was about to cry . " Last night I dreamed my brother was alive again . We were jousting before some great lord , riding Crunch and Pretty Pig , and men were throwing roses at us . We were so happy " <p> Tyrion slapped her . <p> It was a soft blow , all in all , a little flick of the wrist , with hardly any force behind it . It did not even leave a mark upon her cheek . But her eyes filled with tears all the same . <p> " If you want to dream , go back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wake up , we 'll still be escaped slaves in the middle of a siege . Crunch is dead . The pig as well , most like . Now find some armor and put it on , and never mind where it pinches . The mummer show is over . Fight or hide or shit yourself , as you like , but whatever you decide to do , you 'll do it clad in steel . " <p> Penny touched the cheek he 'd slapped . " We should never have run . We 're not sellswords . We 're not any kind of swords . It was n't so bad with Yezzan . It was n't . Nurse was cruel sometimes but Yezzan never was . We were his favorites , his his " <p> " Slaves . The word you want is slaves . " <p> " Slaves , " she said , flushing . " We were his special slaves , though . Just like Sweets . His treasures . " <p> His pets , thought Tyrion . And he loved us so much that he sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> She was not all wrong . Yezzan 's slaves ate better than many peasants back in the Seven Kingdoms and were less like to starve to death come winter . Slaves were chattels , aye . They could be bought and sold , whipped and branded , used for the carnal pleasure of their owners , bred to make more slaves . In that sense they were no more than dogs or horses . But most lords treated their dogs and horses well enough . Proud men might shout that they would sooner die free than live as slaves , but pride was cheap . When the steel struck the flint , such men were rare as dragon 's teeth ; elsewise the world would not have been so full of slaves . There has never been a slave who did not choose to be a slave , the dwarf reflected . Their choice may be between bondage and death , but the choice is always there . Tyrion Lannister did not except himself . His tongue had earned him some stripes on the back in the beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasing Nurse and the noble Yezzan . Jorah Mormont had fought longer and harder , but he would have come to the same place in the end . <p> And Penny , well <p> Penny had been searching for a new master since the day her brother Groat had lost his head . She wants someone to take care of her , someone to tell her what to do . <p> It would have been too cruel to say so , however . Instead Tyrion said , <p> " Yezzan 's special slaves did not escape the pale mare . They 're dead , the lot of them . Sweets was the first to go . " Their mammoth master had died on the day of their escape , Brown Ben Plumm had told him . Neither he nor Kasporio nor any of the other sellswords knew the fate of the denizens of Yezzan 's grotesquerie but if Pretty Penny needed lies to stop her mooning , lie to her he would . " If you want to be a slave again , I will find you a kind master @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough gold to get me home , " Tyrion promised her . " I 'll find you some nice Yunkishman to give you another pretty golden collar , with little bells on it that will tinkle everywhere you go . First , though , you will need to survive what 's coming . No one buys dead mummers . " <p> " Or dead dwarfs , " said Jorah Mormont . " We are all like to be feeding worms by the time this battle is done . The Yunkai'i have lost this war , though it may take them some time to know it . Meereen has an army of Unsullied infantry , the finest in the world . And Meereen has dragons . Three of them , once the queen returns . She will . She must . Our side consists of two score Yunkish lordlings , each with his own half-trained monkey men . Slaves on stilts , slaves in chains they may have troops of blind men and palsied children too , I would not put it past them . " <p> " Oh , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are on the losing side .

@@37756614 @6756614/ <p> Haley McQuire was hiding in Sanctuary 's extensive , beautiful library the night of the pre-Thanksgiving party . She did n't do parties well , and she did n't enjoy them . Jonas Wyatt , Director of Breed Affairs , had given her permission to peruse the extensive collection of first-edition classics , but he had warned her that if one of his enforcers caught her there , they would drag her back to the party . <p> If she was found , she hoped that it was n't by Noble Chavin .

Carpentry books , books on world history . He devoured them , it sometimes seemed .

And though he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her stay . <p> So when the door opened , she hid quickly . She expected the breed entering the room to smell her instantly . She was a human , and fairly easy for a breed to detect . Haley did n't understand why she did n't . Maydene Brock was a breed older , a nurse in the labs . With her graying brown hair and pinched expression , Haley had never really seen her as much of a caregiver . <p> And perhaps she might have sensed Haley if the men following her had n't overpowered the room with the scent of cologne . <p> Haley wrinkled her nose at the smell . Even across the room , hidden behind a low shelf as she peeked between the books , she could smell the obnoxious scents . <p> Maydene sniffed . " We 'll meet you at the hotel with the code .

" Return to the party now , before you 're missed . " Haley peeked over the top of the books that lined the shelf she was hiding behind . She could barely see them , and as the door opened , she eased back down carefully , certain that if Maydene looked back , she would sense her . <p> She waited . She waited so long . She could feel her muscles cramping , feel the sweat that eased along her spine , but she could still feel the danger . <p> She looked up at the vent above her and inhaled slowly . Was that why Maydene had n't smelled her ? The vent pulled the air out of the library and circulated it , while another vent fed dry air into the library to protect the expensive books . That combined with the scent of men 's cologne must have hidden Haley 's scent . But Maydene must have suspected that someone was in the room . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the books again , she heard movement , a doorknob turning , a muttered curse . She took a chance and watched as the breed made her way from the library . Just a few more minutes , she told herself . If Maydene was suspicious , she might watch the door from outside .

I found myself staring into eyes the color of blackstrap molasses . He was a striking man , his features bold , the nose strong , the jaw sturdy . The stubble on his face looked heavy enough to sand paint off a car . He was big-boned and lean , the muscles of his arms and chest as defined as cut stone beneath the worn layer of his T-shirt .

@@37756634 @6756634/ <p> There had been little time to mourn . Upon returning to New York after Lawrence 's murder in Rio ( covered up by the Committee with a proper obituary in the Times ) , Schuyler Van Alen had been on the run . No rest . No respite . A year of constant motion , barely one step ahead of the Venators hunting her . A flight to Buenos Aires followed by one to Dubai . A sleepless night in a youth hostel in Amsterdam followed by another in a bunk bed in an auditorium in Bruges . <p> She had marked her sixteenth birthday aboard the Trans-Siberian Railway , celebrating with a cup of watery Nescafn++n++ coffee and several crumbly Russian tea cookies . Somehow , her best friend , Oliver Hazard-Perry , had found a candle to light in one of the suharkies . He took his job as human Conduit pretty seriously . It was thanks to Oliver 's careful accounting that they had been able to stretch their money so far . The Conclave had frozen his access to the well-funded Hazard-Perry accounts as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was August in Paris , and hot . They had arrived to find most of the city a ghost town : bakeries , boutiques , and bistros shuttered while their proprietors absconded to three-week vacations in the beaches up north . The only people around were American and Japanese tourists , who mobbed every museum gallery , every garden in every public square , inescapable and ubiquitous in their white sneakers and baseball caps . But Schuyler welcomed their presence . She hoped the slow-moving crowds would make it easier for her and Oliver to spot their Venator pursuers . Schuyler had been able to disguise herself by changing her physical features , but performing the mutatio was taking a toll on her . She did n't say anything to Oliver , but lately she could n't even do so much as change the color of her eyes . <p> And now , after almost a year of hiding , they were coming out into the open . It was a gamble , but they were desperate . Living without the protection and wisdom of the secret society of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its toll . And while neither of them would ever admit it , they were both tired of running . <p> So for now Schuyler was seated in the back of a bus , wearing a pressed white shirt buttoned to the neck over slim black pants and flat black shoes with rubber soles . Her dark hair was pulled back in a ponytail , and except for a hint of lip gloss , she wore no makeup . She meant to blend in with the rest of the catering staff who had been hired for the evening . But surely someone would notice . Surely someone would hear how hard her heart was beating , would remark on how her breathing was shallow and quick . She had to calm down . She had to clear her mind and become the blasn++n++ contract caterer she was pretending to be . For so many years Schuyler had excelled at being invisible . This time , her life depended on it . The bus was taking them over a bridge to the H'tel Lambert on the isle Saint-Louis , a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most beautiful house in the most beautiful city in the world . At least , she had always thought so . Although " house " was putting it mildly . " Castle " was more like it , something out of a fairy tale , its massive river walls and gray mansard roofs rising from the surrounding mist . As a child she had played hide-and-seek in the formal gardens , where the conical sculpted trees reminded her of figures on a chessboard . She remembered staging imaginary productions inside the grand courtyard and throwing bread crumbs to the geese from the terrace overlooking the Seine . How she had taken that life for granted ! Tonight she would not enter the hotel 's exclusive , exalted domain as an invited guest , but rather as a humble servant . Like a mouse creeping into a hole . Schuyler was anxious by nature , and she needed almost all her self-control to keep it together . At any moment she feared she might scream , she was already so nervous she could n't stop her hands from trembling . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Next to her , Oliver was handsome in a bartender 's uniform , a tuxedo with a black silk bow tie and silver shirt studs . But he was pale beneath his butterfly collar , his shoulders tense under a jacket that was a little too big . His clear hazel eyes were clouded , looking more gray than green . Oliver 's face did not display the same blank , bored look as the others . He was alert , ready for a fight or flight . Anyone who looked at him long enough could see it . <p> We should n't be here , Schuyler thought . What were we thinking ? The risk is too great . They 're going to find us and separate us ... and then ... well , the rest was too horrible to contemplate . <p> She was sweating under her starched shirt . The air-conditioning was n't working , and the bus was packed . She leaned her head against the windowpane . Lawrence had been dead for over a year now . Four hundred forty-five days . Schuyler kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number , it would stop hurting . <p> This was no game , although sometimes it felt like a horrid , surreal version of cat and mouse . Oliver put a hand on top of hers to try and stop her hands from shaking . The tremors had begun a few months ago , just a slight twitching , but soon she realized she had to concentrate whenever she did something as simple as pick up a fork or open an envelope . She knew what it was , and there was nothing she could do about it . Dr. Pat had told her the first time she visited her office : she was the only one of her kind , Dimidium Cognato , the first half-blood , and there was no telling how her human body would react to the transformation into immortal ; there would be side effects , obstacles particular to her case . Still , she felt better once Oliver held her hand in his . He always knew what to do . She depended on him for so much , and her love for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She squeezed his hand , intertwined her fingers around his . It was his blood that ran through her veins , his quick thinking that had secured her freedom . <p> As for everyone and everything they had left behind in New York , Schuyler did not dwell on it anymore . All of that was in the past . She had made her choice and was at peace with it . She had accepted her life for what it was . Once in a while she missed her friend Bliss very keenly , and more than once wanted to get in touch with her , but that was out of the question . No one could know where they were . No one . Not even Bliss . <p> Maybe they would be lucky tonight . Their luck had held so far . Oh , there had been a few close calls here and there , that one evening in Cologne when she 'd abruptly run from a woman who had asked for directions to the cathedral . Illuminata had given the agent away . Schuyler had caught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fast as she could . Disguises only went so far .

He fell sixty feet to the platform below and died instantly , his neck broken . <p> It took me a long time to understand Daddy was never coming back .

A little smile lingers in one corner of his mouth , and a dimple punctuates the smoothness of his swarthy cheek .

There were bath oils in stoppered crystal bottles , and tins of herbal unguents , and tiny boxes of violet pastilles to freshen the breath . Lower shelves held treasure troves of scented candles and inks , sachets filled with clove-saturated smelling salts , potpourri bowls , and jars of pastes and balms .

Often a customer would come to him requesting that he mix a perfume that contained a predominant scent like roses or lavender , but no one had ever given him a list like this .

I close my eyes and tilt my head back as grief and longing lance through me . Of course I do . <p> Torturous memories flash through my mindthe gliding , holding hands , kissing , the bathtub , his gentleness , his humor , and his dark , brooding , sexy stare . I miss him . It 's been five days , five days of agony that has felt like an eternity . <p> I cry myself to sleep at night , wishing I had n't walked out , wishing that he could be different , wishing that we were together . How long will this hideous overwhelming feeling last ? I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work ! I must be strong , but I want to go to JosT 's show , and deep down , the masochist in me wants to see Christian . Taking a deep breath , I head back to my desk . <p> From : Anastasia Steele <p> Subject : Tomorrow <p> Date : June 8 , 2011 14:25 <p> To : Christian Grey <p> Hi Christian <p> Thank you for the flowers ; they are lovely . <p> Yes , I would appreciate a lift . <p> Thank you . <p> Anastasia Steele <p> Assistant to Jack Hyde , Commissioning Editor , SIP <p> Checking my phone , I find that it is still switched to divert . Jack is in a meeting , so I quickly call JosT . <p> " Hi , JosT . It 's Ana . " <p> " Hello , stranger .

" <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Yes , of course . " I smile my first genuine smile in five days as I picture his broad grin . <p> " Seven thirty . " <p> " See you then . Good-bye , JosT .

I 'm going to see Christian , and for the first time in five days , my spirits lift a fraction and I allow myself to wonder how he 's been . <p> Has he missed me ? Probably not like I 've missed him . Has he found a new submissive from wherever they come from ? The thought is so painful that I dismiss it immediately . I look at the pile of correspondence I need to sort for Jack and tackle it as I try to push Christian out of my mind once more . <p> That night in bed , I toss and turn , trying to sleep . It is the first time in a while I have n't cried myself to sleep . <p> In my mind 's eye , I visualize Christian 's face the last time I saw him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . I remember he did n't want me to go , which was odd . Why would I stay when things had reached such an impasse ? We were each skirting around our own issuesmy fear of punishment , his fear of . . . what ? Love ? <p> Turning on my side , I hug my pillow , filled with an overwhelming sadness . He thinks he does n't deserve to be loved . Why does he feel that way ? Is it something to do with his upbringing ? His birth mom , the crack whore ? My thoughts plague me into the early hours until eventually I fall into a fitful , exhausted sleep . <p> The day drags and drags and Jack is unusually attentive . I suspect it 's Kate 's plum dress and the black high-heeled boots I 've stolen from her closet , but I do n't dwell on the thought . <p> I resolve to go clothes shopping with my first paycheck . The dress is looser on me than it was , but I pretend not to notice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collect my jacket and purse , trying to quell my nerves . I 'm going to see him ! <p> " Do you have a date tonight ? " Jack asks as he strolls past my desk on his way out . <p> " Yes . No . Not really . " <p> He cocks an eyebrow at me , his interest clearly piqued . " Boyfriend ? " I flush . " No , a friend . An ex-boyfriend . " <p> " Maybe tomorrow you 'd like to come for a drink after work . You 've had a stellar first week , Ana . We should celebrate . " He smiles and some unknown emotion flits across his face , making me uneasy . <p> Putting his hands in his pockets , he saunters through the double doors . I frown at his retreating back . Drinks with the boss , is that a good idea ? <p> I shake my head . I have an evening of Christian Grey to get through first . How am I going to do this ? I hurry into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mirror on the wall , I take a long , hard look at my face . I am my usual pale self , dark circles round my too-large eyes . I look gaunt , haunted . <p> Jeez , I wish I knew how to use makeup . I apply some mascara and eyeliner and pinch my cheeks , hoping to bring some color their way . Tidying my hair so that it hangs artfully down my back , I take a deep breath . This will have to do . <p> Nervously I walk through the foyer with a smile and a wave to Claire at reception . I think she and I could become friends . Jack is talking to Elizabeth as I head for the doors . <p> Smiling broadly , he hurries over to open them for me . <p> " After you , Ana , " he murmurs . <p> " Thank you . " I smile , embarrassed . <p> Outside on the curb , Taylor is waiting . He opens the rear door of the car . I glance hesitantly at Jack who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Audi SUV in dismay . <p> I turn and climb into the back , and there he sitsChristian Greywearing his gray suit , no tie , his white shirt open at the collar . His gray eyes are glowing . <p> My mouth dries . He looks glorious except he 's scowling at me . Oh no ! <p> " When did you last eat ? " he snaps as Taylor closes the door behind me . <p> Crap . " Hello , Christian . Yes , it 's nice to see you , too . " <p> " I do n't want your smart mouth now . Answer me . " His eyes blaze . <p> Holy shit . " Um . . . I had a yogurt at lunchtime . Ohand a banana . " <p> " When did you last have a proper meal ? " he asks acidly . <p> Taylor slips into the driver 's seat , starts the car , and pulls out into the traffic . <p> I glance up and Jack is waving at me , though how he can see me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wave back . <p> " Who 's that ? " Christian snaps . <p> " My boss . " I peek up at the beautiful man beside me , and his mouth is pressed into a hard line . <p> " Well ? Your last meal ? " <p> " Christian , that really is none of your concern , " I murmur , feeling extraordinarily brave . <p> " Whatever you do concerns me . Tell me . " <p> No , it does n't . I groan in frustration , rolling my eyes heavenward , and Christian narrows his eyes . And for the first time in a long time , I want to laugh . I try hard to stifle the giggle that threatens to bubble up . Christian 's face softens as I struggle to keep a straight face , and I see a trace of a smile kiss his beautifully sculptured lips . <p> " Well ? " he asks , his voice softer . <p> " Pasta alla vongole , last Friday , " I whisper . <p> He closes his eyes as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I see , " he says , his voice expressionless . " You look like you 've lost at least five pounds , possibly more since then . Please eat , Anastasia , " he scolds . <p> I stare down at the knotted fingers in my lap . Why does he always make me feel like an errant child ? <p> He shifts and turns toward me . " How are you ? " he asks , his voice still soft . <p> Well , I 'm shit really . . . I swallow . " If I told you I was fine , I 'd be lying . " He inhales sharply . " Me , too , " he murmurs and reaches over and clasps my hand . " I miss you , " he adds . <p> " Oh , baby , no . " He tugs my hand , and before I know it I 'm on his lap . He has his arms around me , and his nose is in my hair . " I 've missed you so much , Anastasia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of his hold , to maintain some distance , but his arms are wrapped around me . He 's pressing me to his chest . I melt . Oh , this is where I want to be . <p> I rest my head against him , and he kisses my hair repeatedly . This is home . He smells of linen , fabric softener , body wash , and my favorite smellChristian . For a moment , I allow myself the illusion that all will be well , and it soothes my ravaged soul . <p> A few minutes later Taylor pulls to a stop at the curb , even though we 're still in the city . <p> " Come " Christian shifts me off his lap " we 're here . " What ? <p> " Helipadon the top of this building . " Christian glances toward the building by way of explanation . <p> I flush as Christian comes around the car and takes my hand . He looks quizzically at Taylor who stares impassively back at him , revealing nothing . <p> " Nine ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sir . " <p> Christian nods as he turns and leads me through the double doors into the grandiose foyer . I revel in the feel of his large hand and his long , skilled fingers curled around mine . <p> I feel the familiar pullI am drawn , Icarus to his sun . I have been burned already , and yet here I am again . <p> Reaching the elevators , he presses the call button . I peek up at him , and he 's wearing his enigmatic half smile . As the doors open , he releases my hand and ushers me in . <p> The doors close and I risk a second peek . He glances down at me , gray eyes alive , and it 's there in the air between us , that electricity . It 's palpable . I can almost taste it , pulsing between us , drawing us together . <p> " Oh my , " I gasp as I bask briefly in the intensity of this visceral , primal attraction . <p> I gaze up at him , releasing my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the elevator . How could I not ? <p> " You know what it does to me , " he murmurs . <p> Oh , I still affect him . My inner goddess stirs from her five-day sulk . <p> Abruptly the doors open , breaking the spell , and we 're on the roof . It 's windy , and despite my black jacket , I 'm cold . Christian puts his arm around me , pulling me into his side , and we hurry across to where Charlie Tango stands in the center of the helipad with its rotor blades slowly spinning . <p> A tall , blond , square-jawed man in a dark suit leaps out and , ducking low , runs toward us . Shaking hands with Christian , he shouts above the noise of the rotors . <p> Once inside he buckles me firmly into my harness , cinching the straps tight . He gives me a knowing look and his secret smile . <p> " This should keep you in your place , " he murmurs . " I must say I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> I flush a deep crimson , and he runs his index finger down my cheek before handing me the headphones . I 'd like to touch you , too , but you wo n't let me . I scowl at him . Besides , he 's pulled the straps so tight I can barely move . <p> He sits in his seat and buckles himself in , then starts running through all his preflight checks . He 's just so competent . It 's very alluring . He puts on his headphones and flips a switch and the rotors speed up , deafening me . <p> Turning , he gazes at me . " Ready , baby ? " His voice echoes through the headphones . <p> His lips twitch into a smile . " I have missed your smart mouth . " I gasp and I want to shout , I 've missed youall of younot just your mouth ! But I keep quiet and gaze out the glass fishbowl that is Charlie Tango 's windshield as we continue south . The dusk is to our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fiery orangeand I am Icarus again , flying far too close . <p> The dusk has followed us from Seattle , and the sky is awash with opal , pinks , and aquamarines woven seamlessly together as only Mother Nature knows how . It 's a clear , crisp evening , and the lights of Portland twinkle and wink , welcoming us as Christian sets the helicopter down on the helipad . We are on top of the strange brown brick building in Portland we left less than three weeks ago . <p> Jeez , it 's been hardly any time at all . Yet I feel like I 've known Christian for a lifetime . <p> He powers down Charlie Tango , flipping various switches so the rotors stop , and eventually all I hear is my own breathing through the headphones . Hmm . Briefly it reminds me of the Thomas Tallis experience . I blanch . I so do n't want to go there right now . <p> " Well , let 's go see the boy 's photos . " He holds his hand out to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tango . <p> A gray-haired man with a beard walks over to meet us , smiling broadly , and I recognize him as the old-timer from the last time we were here . <p> " Joe . " Christian smiles and releases my hand to shake Joe 's warmly . <p> " Keep her safe for Stephan . He 'll be along around eight or nine . " <p> " Will do , Mr. Grey . Ma'am , " he says , nodding at me . " Your car 's waiting downstairs , sir . Oh , and the elevator 's out of order ; you 'll need to use the stairs . " <p> " Thank you , Joe . " <p> Christian takes my hand , and we head to the emergency stairs . <p> " Good thing for you this is only three floors , in those heels , " he mutters to me in disapproval . <p> No kidding . <p> " Do n't you like the boots ? " <p> " I like them very much , Anastasia . " His gaze darkens and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Come . We 'll take it slow . I do n't want you falling and breaking your neck . " <p> We sit in silence as our driver takes us to the gallery . My anxiety has returned full force , and I realize that our time in Charlie Tango has been the eye of the storm . Christian is quiet and brooding . . . apprehensive even ; our lighter mood from earlier has dissipated . There 's so much I want to say , but this journey is too short . Christian stares pensively out the window . <p> " JosT is just a friend , " I murmur . <p> Christian turns and gazes at me , his eyes dark and guarded , giving nothing away . His mouthoh , his mouth is distracting , and unbidden . I remember it on meeverywhere . My skin heats . He shifts in his seat and frowns . <p> The car pulls up in front of the gallery , and Christian climbs out , leaving me speechless . He opens the car door for me , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ? " My voice is louder than I expected . <p> " Do what ? " Christian is taken aback . <p> " Say something like that and then just stop . " <p> " Anastasia , we 're here . Where you want to be . Let 's do this and then talk . I do n't particularly want a scene in the street . " <p> I flush and glance around . He 's right . It 's too public . I press my lips together as he glares down at me . <p> " Okay , " I mutter sulkily . Taking my hand , he leads me into the building . <p> We are in a converted warehousebrick walls , dark wood floors , white ceilings , and white pipe work . It 's airy and modern , and there are several people wandering across the gallery floor , sipping wine and admiring JosT 's work . For a moment , my troubles melt away as I grasp that JosT has realized his dream . Way to go , JosT ! <p> " Good evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young woman dressed in black with very short brown hair , bright red lipstick , and large hooped earrings greets us . <p> She glances briefly at me , then much longer than is strictly necessary at Christian , then turns back to me , blinking as she blushes . <p> My brow creases . He 's mineor was . I try hard not to scowl at her . As her eyes regain their focus , she blinks again . <p> " Oh , it 's you , Ana . We 'll want your take on all this , too . " Grinning , she hands me a brochure and directs me to a table laden with drinks and snacks . <p> How does she know my name ? <p> " You know her ? " Christian frowns . <p> I shake my head , equally puzzled . <p> He shrugs , distracted . " What would you like to drink ? " <p> " I 'll have a glass of white wine , thank you . " <p> His brow furrows , but he holds his tongue and heads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> JosT comes barreling through a throng of people . <p> Holy cow ! He 's wearing a suit . He looks good and he 's beaming at me . He enfolds me in his arms , hugging me hard . And it 's all I can do not to burst into tears . My friend , my only friend while Kate is away . Tears pool in my eyes . <p> " Ana , I 'm so glad you made it , " he whispers in my ear , then pauses and abruptly holds me at arm 's length , staring at me . <p> " What ? " <p> " Hey are you okay ? You look , well , odd . Dios mio , have you lost weight ? " I blink back my tears . " JosT , I 'm fine . I 'm just so happy for you . " Crapnot him , too . <p> " Congratulations on the show . " My voice wavers as I see his concern etched on his oh-so-familiar face , but I have to hold myself together . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nod in Christian 's direction and see he 's exchanging pleasantries with someone waiting in line . Christian glances up when I look his way and our eyes lock . And in that brief moment , I 'm paralyzed , staring at the impossibly handsome man who gazes at me with some unfathomable emotion . His gaze hot , burning into me , and we 're lost for a moment staring at each other . <p> " Ana ! " JosT distracts me , and I 'm dragged back to the here and now . " I am so glad you camelisten , I should warn you " <p> Suddenly , Miss Very Short Hair and Red Lipstick cuts him off . " JosT , the journalist from the Portland Printz is here to see you . Come on . " She gives me a polite smile . <p> " How cool is this ? The fame . " He grins , and I ca n't help but grin backhe 's so happy . <p> " Catch you later , Ana . " He kisses my cheek , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tall lanky photographer . <p> JosT 's photographs are everywhere , and in some cases , blown up onto huge canvases . <p> There are both monochromes and colors . There 's an ethereal beauty to many of the landscapes . In one taken out near the lake at Vancouver , it 's early evening and pink clouds are reflected in the stillness of the water . Briefly , I 'm transported by the tranquility and the peace . It 's stunning . <p> Christian joins me , and I take a deep breath and swallow , trying to recover some of my earlier equilibrium . He hands me my glass of white wine . <p> " Does it come up to scratch ? " My voice sounds more normal . <p> He looks quizzically at me . <p> " The wine . " <p> " No . Rarely does at these kinds of events . The boy 's quite talented , is n't he ? " Christian is admiring the lake photo . <p> " Why else do you think I asked him to take your portrait ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His eyes glide impassively from the photograph to me . <p> " Christian Grey ? " The photographer from the Portland Printz approaches Christian . <p> " Can I have a picture , sir ? " <p> " Sure . " Christian hides his scowl . I step back , but he grabs my hand and pulls me to his side . The photographer looks at both of us and ca n't hide his surprise . <p> No , I do n't do dates , Anastasiaonly with you . But you know that . " His eyes burn with sincerity . <p> " So you never took your " I glance around nervously to check no one can overhear us " subs out ? " <p> " Sometimes . Not on dates . Shopping , you know . " He shrugs , his eyes not leaving mine . <p> Oh , so just in the playroomhis Red Room of Pain and his apartment . I do n't know what to feel about that . <p> " Just you , Anastasia , " he whispers . <p> I blush and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he does care about me . <p> " Your friend here seems more of a landscape man , not portraits . Let 's look round . " He holds his hand out to me , and I take it . <p> We wander past a few more prints , and I notice a couple nodding at me , smiling broadly as if they know me . It must be because I 'm with Christian , but one young man is blatantly staring . Odd . <p> We turn the corner , and I can see why I 've been getting strange looks . Hanging on the far wall are seven huge portraitsof me . <p> I stare blankly at them , stupefied , the blood draining from my face . Me : pouting , laughing , scowling , serious , amused . All in super close up , all in black and white . <p> Holy crap ! I remember JosT messing with the camera on a couple of occasions when he was visiting and when I 'd been out with him as driver and photographer 's assistant . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these invasive candids . <p> I glance up at Christian , who is staring , transfixed , at each of the pictures in turn . <p> " Seems I 'm not the only one , " he mutters cryptically , his mouth settling into a hard line.I think he 's angry . Oh no . <p> " Excuse me , " he says , pinning me with his bright gray gaze for a moment . He turns and heads to the reception desk . <p> What 's his problem now ? I watch mesmerized as he talks animatedly with Miss Very Short Hair and Red Lipstick . He fishes out his wallet and produces his credit card . <p> Shit . He must have bought one of them . <p> " Hey . You 're the muse . These photographs are terrific . " A young man with a shock of bright blond hair startles me . I feel a hand at my elbow and Christian is back . <p> " You 're a lucky guy . " Blond Shock smirks at Christian , who gives him a cold stare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darkly , as he pulls me over to one side . <p> " Did you just buy one of these ? " <p> " One of these ? " he snorts , not taking his eyes off them . <p> " You bought more than one ? " <p> He rolls his eyes . " I bought them all , Anastasia . I do n't want some stranger ogling you in the privacy of their home . " <p> My first inclination is to laugh . " You 'd rather it was you ? " I scoff . <p> He glares down at me , caught off guard by my audacity , I think , but he 's trying to hide his amusement . <p> " Frankly , yes . " <p> " Pervert , " I mouth at him and bite my lower lip to prevent my smile . <p> His mouth drops open , and now his amusement is obvious . He strokes his chin thoughtfully . " Ca n't argue with that assessment , Anastasia . " He shakes his head , and his eyes soften with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , but I 've signed an NDA . " He sighs , gazing at me , and his eyes darken . " What I 'd like to do to your smart mouth , " he murmurs . <p> I gasp , knowing full well what he means . " You 're very rude . " I try to sound shocked and succeed . Does he have no boundaries ? <p> He smirks at me , amused , and then he frowns . <p> " You look very relaxed in these photographs , Anastasia . I do n't see you like that very often . " <p> I flush and glance down at my fingers . He tilts my head back , and I inhale sharply at the contact with his long fingers . <p> " I want you that relaxed with me , " he whispers . All trace of humor has gone . <p> Deep inside me that joy stirs again . But how can this be ? We have issues . <p> " You have to stop intimidating me if you want that , " I snap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell me how you feel , " he snaps back , eyes blazing . <p> I take a deep breath . " Christian , you wanted me as a submissive . That 's where the problem lies . It 's in the definition of a submissiveyou e-mailed it to me once . " I pause , trying to recall the wording . " I think the synonyms were , and I quote , compliant , pliant , amenable , passive , tractable , resigned , patient , docile , tame , subdued . ' I was n't supposed to look at you . Not talk to you unless you gave me permission to do so . What do you expect ? " I hiss at him . <p> He blinks , and his frown deepens as I continue . <p> " It 's very confusing being with you . You do n't want me to defy you , but then you like my smart mouth . ' You want obedience , except when you do n't , so you can punish me . I just do n't know which way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He narrows his eyes . " Good point well made , as usual , Miss Steele . " His voice is frigid . " Come , let 's go eat . " <p> " We 've only been here for half an hour . " <p> " You 've seen the photos ; you 've spoken to the boy . " <p> " His name is JosT . " <p> " You 've spoken to JosTthe man who , the last time I met him , was trying to push his tongue into your reluctant mouth while you were drunk and i 'll , " he snarls . <p> I drag my gaze away from him and scan the room for JosT . He 's talking to a group of young women . I stalk off toward him and away from Fifty . Just because he brought me here , I have to do as he says ? Who the hell does he think he is ? <p> The girls are hanging on JosT 's every word . One of them gasps as I approach , no doubt recognizing me from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ana . Excuse me , girls . " JosT grins at them and puts his arm around me , and on some level I 'm amusedJosT all smooth , impressing the ladies . <p> " You look mad , " he says . <p> " I have to go , " I mutter mulishly . <p> " You just got here . " <p> " I know but Christian needs to get back . The pictures are fantastic , JosTyou 're very talented . " <p> He beams . " It was so cool seeing you . " <p> Jose sweeps me into a big bear hug , spinning me so I can see Christian across the gallery . He 's scowling , and I realize it 's because I 'm in JosT 's arms . So in a very calculating move , I wrap my arms around JosT 's neck . I think Christian is going to expire . His glare darkens to something quite sinister , and slowly he makes his way toward us . <p> " Mr. Rodriguez , very impressive . " Christian sounds icily polite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but we need to head back to Seattle . Anastasia ? " He subtly stresses we and takes my hand as he does so . <p> " Bye , JosT . Congratulations again . " I give him a quick kiss on the cheek , and before I know it Christian is dragging me out of the building . I know he 's boiling with silent wrath , but so am I. <p> He looks quickly up and down the street then heads left and suddenly sweeps me into a side alley , abruptly pushing me up against a wall . He grabs my face between his hands , forcing me to look up into his ardent determined eyes . <p> I gasp , and his mouth swoops down . He 's kissing me , violently . Briefly our teeth clash , then his tongue is in my mouth . <p> Desire explodes like the Fourth of July throughout my body , and I 'm kissing him back , matching his fervor , my hands knotting in his hair , pulling it , hard . He groans , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reverberates through me , and his hand moves down my body to the top of my thigh , his fingers digging into my flesh through the plum dress . <p> I pour all the angst and heartbreak of the last few days into our kiss , binding him to me , and it hits mein this moment of blinding passionhe 's doing the same , he feels the same . <p> He breaks off the kiss , panting . His eyes are luminous with desire , firing the already heated blood that is pounding through my body . My mouth is slack as I try to drag precious air into my lungs . <p> " You . Are . Mine , " he snarls , emphasizing each word . He pushes away from me and bends , hands on his knees as if he 's run a marathon . " For the love of God , Ana . " I lean against the wall , panting , trying to control the riotous reaction in my body , trying to find my equilibrium again . <p> " I 'm sorry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You should be . I know what you were doing . Do you want the photographer , Anastasia ? He obviously has feelings for you . " <p> I flush and shake my head . <p> " No . He 's just a friend . " <p> " I have spent all my adult life trying to avoid any extreme emotion . Yet you . . . you bring out feelings in me that are completely alien . It 's very . . . " He frowns , grasping for the word . " Unsettling . <p> " I like control , Ana , and around you that just " he stands , his gaze intense " evaporates . " He waves his hand vaguely , then runs it through his hair and takes a deep breath . He clasps my hand .

The hairs at the back of her neck rose in anticipation of danger and a certainty that she was pushing her luck far past its limit this morning . <p> She twisted , throwing her body to the side before coming to a crouch and staring back at Diane Broen with narrowed eyes . <p> The other woman came to a stop , her brow arching in mocking surprise as Liza faced her suspiciously .

" said Joan . <p> " What about it ? " <p> " I was just wondering about the status . Professional courtesy . " <p> " I ca n't talk to you about an ongoing investigation . You know that . " <p> " But you can tell me certain things that are n't confidential or that wo n't jeopardize your investigation , but as yet have n't made a public splash . " <p> Parks shrugged . " I 'm not sure I know what you mean . " <p> " For instance , you have n't arrested Sean King , presumably because , despite certain circumstantial evidence that seems to implicate him , you do n't believe he 's guilty . And possibly you have facts that point in other directions . And he could n't have killed Susan Whitehead because he was n't here . In fact , I believe that you provided him with an alibi . " <p> " How do you know that ? " <p> " I 'm an investigator , so I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who killed Howard Jennings and the one who killed Susan Whitehead need n't be the same . The crimes could be totally unrelated . " <p> " I do n't think so and neither do you . It seems to me that while the crimes are very different they are also very much the same . " <p> Parks shook his head wearily . " I know you 're real smart and I 'm real stupid , but the more you talk , the less I understand what the hell you 're saying . " <p> " Let 's suppose that Jennings was n't killed because he was in WITSEC . Let 's suppose he was killed because he worked for Sean King . " <p> " Why ? " <p> She ignored his question . " Now Susan Whitehead was killed elsewhere and then brought to Sean 's house . In neither case is the evidence strong enough to show that he killed the victim , and in fact , in Whitehead 's case the proof is the other way entirely : he had an alibi . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his gun was the murder weapon , " countered the deputy Marshall . <p> " Yes , he explained the gun substitution theory , which I take it you agree with . " <p> " I 'm not going to say one way or another . Here 's one theory : Jennings was killed by his old partners in crime , and they tried to frame King for it . His gun , no real alibi , body in his office , a classic setup . " <p> " Yet could they be sure ? " wondered Joan . <p> " Sure of what ? " <p> " Sure that Sean would n't have an alibi that night ? He could have easily had an emergency call to go on while he was on duty , or someone that saw him at the time Jennings was killed .

" <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had met someone along the way or received a call at the time he was downtown , he has an alibi and the case goes away . " <p> " So where does that leave us ? " asked Parks . <p> " With your framers not really caring if Sean is arrested for the crime or not . And in my experience framers are rarely so sloppy . If they were careful enough to steal his gun , copy it down to the last detail , kill Jennings with it and then return it to Sean 's house , they would have chosen a time and place for the killing that would have allowed Sean no possibility of an alibi . In short , I ca n't allow for such extraordinarily careful planning with the weapon and such carelessness with the alibi . <p> Murderers are seldom so schizophrenic in their work . " <p> " Well , King could have rigged this all himself , to throw us off .

" And with that she abruptly ended the meeting . <p> * * * <p> After Parks left , Joan took the piece of paper out of her purse . She 'd persuaded one of the county deputies to let her make a copy of the note found on Susan Whitehead 's body while King and Chief Williams were occupied elsewhere . After reading through it she took from her wallet another piece of paper she 'd kept all these years . She carefully unfolded it and stared at the few words written on it . <p> The note she was holding was one that she believed Sean had left for her in her room at the Fairmount Hotel on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lovemaking she slept in , and King went on duty . When she woke up , she saw the note and did precisely what it asked , even though the request carried some professional risk .

She said nothing back then for a simple reason : It would have ruined her career . Now this new development had thrown an entirely new angle on all of this . 
@@37756651 @6756651/ <p> At Winterfell they had called her " Arya Horseface " and she 'd thought nothing could be worse , but that was before the orphan boy Lommy Greenhands had named her " Lumpyhead . " <p> Her head felt lumpy when she touched it . When Yoren had dragged her into that alley she 'd thought he meant to kill her , but the sour old man had only held her tight , sawing through her mats and tangles with his dagger . She remembered how the breeze sent the fistfuls of dirty brown hair skittering across the paving stones , toward the sept where her father had died . " I 'm taking men and boys from the city , " Yoren growled as the sharp steel scraped at her head . " Now you hold still , boy .

" <p> Leaving King 's Landing was easy , just like he 'd said . The Lannister guardsmen on the gate were stopping everyone , but Yoren called one by name and their wagons were waved through .

When she remembered that , Arya decided to wish for Winterfell instead . <p> Yoren was wrong about the pissing , though . That was n't the hardest part at all ; Lommy Greenhands and Hot Pie were the hardest part . Orphan boys . Yoren had plucked some from the streets with promises of food for their bellies and shoes for their feet . The rest he 'd found in chains .

One had no nose , only the hole in his face where it had been cut off , and the gross fat bald one with the pointed teeth and the weeping sores on his cheeks had eyes like nothing human . <p> They took five wagons out of King 's Landing , laden with supplies for the Wall : hides and bolts of cloth , bars of pig iron , a cage of ravens , books and paper and ink , a bale of sourleaf , jars of oil , and chests of medicine and spices . Teams of plow horses pulled the wagons , and Yoren had bought two coursers and a half-dozen donkeys for the boys . Arya would have preferred a real horse , but the donkey was better than riding on a wagon . <p> The men paid her no mind , but she was not so lucky with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ youngest orphan , not to mention smaller and skinnier , and Lommy and Hot Pie took her silence to mean she was scared , or stupid , or deaf .

He 'd been a dyer 's apprentice before he was caught stealing , and his arms were mottled green to the elbow . When he laughed he brayed like the donkeys they were riding . " Where 's a gutter rat like Lumpyhead get him a sword ? " <p> Arya chewed her lip sullenly . She could see the back of Yoren 's faded black cloak up ahead of the wagons , but she was determined not to go crying to him for help . <p> " He ai n't no squire , look at him .

Maybe she had to let them call her Lumpyhead , but she was n't going to let them call Jon a thief . <p> " If he stole it , we could take it off him , " said Hot Pie . " It 's not his anyhow . I could use me a sword like that . " <p> Lommy egged him on . " Go on , take it off him , I dare you . " <p> Hot Pie kicked his donkey , riding closer . " Hey , Lumpyface , you gim me that sword .

I killed a boy , a fat boy like you , I stabbed him in the belly and he died , and I 'll kill you too if you do n't let me alone . Only she did not dare . Yoren did n't know about the stableboy , but she was afraid of what he might do if he found out . Arya was pretty sure that some of the other men were killers too , the three in the manacles for sure , but the queen was n't looking for them , so it was n't the same . <p> She had cried in her sleep the night before , dreaming of her father . Come morning , she 'd woken red-eyed and dry , and could not have shed another tear if her life had hung on it . <p> " He 's going to wet his pants , " Hot Pie suggested . <p> " Leave him be , " said the boy with the shaggy black hair who rode behind them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this horned helm he had that he polished all the time but never wore .

" Hot Pie wants it bad . He kicked a boy to death . He 'll do the same to you , I bet .

She vaulted off her own donkey and poked him in the gut as he tried to get up and he sat back down with a grunt . Then she whacked him across the face and his nose made a crack like a branch breaking . Blood dribbled from his nostrils . When Hot Pie began to wail , Arya whirled toward Lommy Greenhands , who was sitting on his donkey openmouthed . " You want some sword too ? " she yelled , but he did n't . He raised dyed green hands in front of his face and squealed at her to get away . <p> The Bull shouted , " Behind you , " and Arya spun .

He raised a hand and she hit it , and then his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , and she danced aside and bounced the wood off the back of his head . He fell down and got up and stumbled after her , his red face all smeared with dirt and blood . Arya slid into a water dancer 's stance and waited . When he came close enough , she lunged , right between his legs , so hard that if her wooden sword had had a point it would have come out between his butt cheeks . <p> By the time Yoren pulled her off him , Hot Pie was sprawled out on the ground with his breeches brown and smelly , crying as Arya whapped him over and over and over . " Enough , " the black brother roared , prying the stick sword from her fingers , " you want to kill the fool ? " When Lommy and some others started to squeal , the old man turned on them too .

Now . " <p> They were all looking at her , even the three chained and manacled in the back of the wagon . The fat one snapped his pointy teeth together and hissed , but Arya ignored him . <p> The old man dragged her well off the road into a tangle of trees , cursing and muttering all the while . " If I had a thimble o ' sense , I would 've left you in King 's Landing . You hear me , boy ? " He always snarled that word , putting a bite in it so she would be certain to hear . " Unlace your breeches and pull em down . Go on , there 's no one here to see . Do it . " <p> Sullenly , Arya did as he said . " Over there , against the oak . Yes , like that .

" Think that hurt ? " he said . " Try this one . " The stick came whistling . Arya shrieked again , clutching the tree to keep from falling . " One more . " She held on tight , chewing her lip , flinching when she heard it coming . The stroke made her jump and howl . I wo n't cry , she thought , I wo n't do that . I 'm a Stark of Winterfell , our sigil is the direwolf , direwolves do n't cry . She could feel a thin trickle of blood running down her left leg . Her thighs and cheeks were ablaze with pain .

Now cover yourself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she bent to yank up her breeches , but she knew better than to say so . Her hands fumbled with her belt and laces . <p> Yoren was looking at her .

I was set to leave , wagons bought and loaded , and a man comes with a boy for me , and a purse of coin , and a message , never mind who it 's from . Lord Eddard 's to take the black , he says to me , wait , he 'll be going with you . Why d' you think I was there ? Only something went queer . " <p> " Joffrey , " Arya breathed .

" You 'll chew some , it 'll help with the sting . " <p> It did help , some , though the taste of it was foul and it made her spit look like blood . Even so , she walked for the rest of that day , and the day after , and the day after that , too raw to sit a donkey . Hot Pie was worse off ; Yoren had to shift some barrels around so he could lie in the back of a wagon on some sacks of barley , and he whimpered every time the wheels hit a rock . Lommy Greenhands was n't even hurt , yet he stayed as far away from Arya as he could get . " Every time you look at him , he twitches , " the Bull told her as she walked beside his donkey .

Yoren had made her look away when it happened , yet it seemed to her that the comet looked like Ice must have , after . <p> When at last she slept , she dreamed of home . The kingsroad wound its way past Winterfell on its way to the Wall , and Yoren had promised he 'd leave her there with no one any wiser about who she 'd been .

And then Poppys chances of marrying a respectable and perfectly wonderful young man would be forever lost . <p> Dodger hurried through the luxurious hallways of the Rutledge Hotel in a sinuous lope , staying just out of reach . The letter was clamped in his long front teeth . <p> As she dashed after him , Poppy prayed that she would not be seen . No matter how reputable the hotel , a respectable young woman should never have left her suite unescorted . However , Miss Marks , her companion , was still abed . And Beatrix had gone for an early morning ride with their sister , Amelia . <p> " Youre going to pay for this , Dodger !

And because Poppy loved her younger sister , she had tried to endure living with the obnoxious pet . <p> This time , however , Dodger had gone too far . <p> The ferret paused at a corner , checked to make certain he was still being chased , and in his happy excitement , he did a little war dance , a series of sideways hops that expressed pure delight . Even now , when Poppy wanted to murder him , she could n't help but acknowledge that he was adorable .

She wanted peace . Predictability . <p> Dodger ran through the doorway of the third-floor stewards offices , which belonged to Mr. Brimbley . The steward was an elderly man with a full white mustache , the ends neatly waxed into points . As the Hathaways had stayed at the Rutledge many times in the past , Poppy knew that Brimbley reported every detail of what occurred on his floor to his superiors .

The two connected rooms appeared to be unoccupied . " Dodger , " she whispered urgently , and saw him scurry beneath a chair . " Dodger , do come here !

No amount of Armani tailoring could soften that build big framed and rugged like a roughneck or a bull rider .

Only then did I risk another glance . <p> Those blue eyes glinted with an uncivilized suggestion . A faint smile was tucked in one corner of his wide mouth . Definitely would n't want to be alone in a room with that guy , I thought .

The first three men had offered their lives to the Drowned God fearlessly , but the fourth was weak in faith and began to struggle as his lungs cried out for air . Standing waist-deep in the surf , Aeron seized the naked boy by the shoulders and pushed his head back down as he tried to snatch a breath . " Have courage , " he said .

Facedown in the shallow sea floated Emmond , pale and cold and peaceful . <p> That was when the Damphair realized that three horsemen had joined his drowned men on the pebbled shore . Aeron knew the Sparr , a hatchet-faced old man with watery eyes whose quavery voice was law on this part of Great Wyk . His son Steffarion accompanied him , with another youth whose dark red fur-lined cloak was pinned at the shoulder with an ornate brooch that showed the black-and-gold warhorn of the Goodbrothers . One of Gorold 's sons , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been born to Goodbrother 's wife late in life , after a dozen daughters , and it was said that no man could tell one son from the others .

Whether this be Greydon or Gormond or Gran , the priest had no time for him . <p> He growled a brusque command , and his drowned men seized the dead boy by his arms and legs to carry him above the tideline . The priest followed , naked but for a sealskin clout that covered his private parts . Goosefleshed and dripping , he splashed back onto land , across cold wet sand and sea-scoured pebbles . One of his drowned men handed him a robe of heavy roughspun dyed in mottled greens and blues and greys , the colors of the sea and the Drowned God . Aeron donned the robe and pulled his hair free . Black and wet , that hair ; no blade had touched it since the sea had raised him up . It draped his shoulders like a ragged , ropy cloak , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seaweed through it , and through his tangled , uncut beard . <p> His drowned men formed a circle around the dead boy , praying . Norjen worked his arms whilst Rus knelt astride him , pumping on his chest , but all moved aside for Aeron . He pried apart the boy 's cold lips with his fingers and gave Emmond the kiss of life , and again , and again , until the sea came gushing from his mouth . The boy began to cough and spit , and his eyes blinked open , full of fear . <p> Another one returned . It was a sign of the Drowned God 's favor , men said . Every other priest lost a man from time to time , even Tarle the Thrice-Drowned , who had once been thought so holy that he was picked to crown a king . But never Aeron Greyjoy .

" <p> " You belong to the god now , " Aeron told him . The other drowned men gathered round and each gave him a punch and a kiss to welcome him to the brotherhood . One helped him don a roughspun robe of mottled blue and green and grey . Another presented him with a driftwood cudgel . " You belong to the sea now , so the sea has armed you , " Aeron said . " We pray that you shall wield your cudgel fiercely , against all the enemies of our god .

" I was drowned as a boy , " he said , " and my son upon his name day . " <p> Aeron snorted . That Steffarion Sparr had been given to the Drowned God soon after birth he had no doubt . He knew the manner of it too , a quick dip into a tub of seawater that scarce wet the infant 's head . Small wonder the ironborn had been conquered , they who once held sway everywhere the sound of waves was heard . " That is no true drowning , " he told the riders . " He that does not die in truth can not hope to rise from death . Why have you come , if not to prove your faith ? " <p> " Lord Gorold 's son came seeking you , with news .

" I have the god 's work to do . " Aeron Greyjoy was a prophet .

I have no secrets from them , nor from our god , beside whose holy sea I stand . " <p> The horsemen exchanged a look . " Tell him , " said the Sparr , and the youth in the red cloak summoned up his courage . " The king is dead , " he said , as plain as that . Four small words , yet the sea itself trembled when he uttered them . <p> Four kings there were in Westeros , yet Aeron did not need to ask which one was meant . Balon Greyjoy ruled the Iron Islands , and no other . The king is dead . How can that be ? Aeron had seen his eldest brother not a moon 's turn past , when he had returned to the Iron Islands from harrying the Stony Shore . Balon 's grey hair had gone half-white whilst the priest had been away , and the stoop in his shoulders was more pronounced than when the longships sailed . Yet all in all the king had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life upon two mighty pillars . Those four small words had knocked one down . Only the Drowned God remains to me . May he make me as strong and tireless as the sea . " Tell me the manner of my brother 's death . " <p> " His Grace was crossing a bridge at Pyke when he fell and was dashed upon the rocks below . " <p> The Greyjoy stronghold stood upon a broken headland , its keeps and towers built atop massive stone stacks that thrust up from the sea . Bridges knotted Pyke together ; arched bridges of carved stone and swaying spans of hempen rope and wooden planks . " Was the storm raging when he fell ? " Aeron demanded of them . <p> " Aye , " the youth said , " it was . " <p> " The Storm God cast him down , " the priest announced . For a thousand thousand years sea and sky had been at war .

" He pushed the cork back into his waterskin . " I shall speak with your lord father . How far from here to Hammerhorn ? " <p> The youth hesitated half a heartbeat , then dismounted and held the reins for the Damphair . Aeron shoved a bare black foot into a stirrup and swung himself onto the saddle . He was not fond of horsesthey were creatures from the green lands and helped to make men weakbut necessity required that he ride . Dark wings , dark words . A storm was brewing , he could hear it in the waves , and storms brought naught but evil . " Meet with me at Pebbleton beneath Lord Merlyn 's tower , " he told his drowned men , as he turned the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up hills and woods and stony defiles , along a narrow track that oft seemed to disappear beneath the horse 's hooves . Great Wyk was the largest of the Iron Islands , so vast that some of its lords had holdings that did not front upon the holy sea . Gorold Goodbrother was one such . His keep was in the Hardstone Hills , as far from the Drowned God 's realm as any place in the isles . Gorold 's folk toiled down in Gorold 's mines , in the stony dark beneath the earth . Some lived and died without setting eyes upon salt water . Small wonder that such folk are crabbed and queer . <p> As Aeron rode , his thoughts turned to his brothers . <p> Nine sons had been born from the loins of Quellon Greyjoy , the Lord of the Iron Islands . Harlon , Quenton , and Donel had been born of Lord Quellon 's first wife , a woman of the Stonetrees . Balon , Euron , Victarion , Urrigon , and Aeron were the sons of his second , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took a girl from the green lands , who gave him a sickly idiot boy named Robin , the brother best forgotten . The priest had no memory of Quenton or Donel , who had died as infants . Harlon he recalled but dimly , sitting grey-faced and still in a windowless tower room and speaking in whispers that grew fainter every day as the greyscale turned his tongue and lips to stone . One day we shall feast on fish together in the Drowned God 's watery halls , the four of us and Urri too . <p> Nine sons had been born from the loins of Quellon Greyjoy , but only four had lived to manhood . That was the way of this cold world , where men fished the sea and dug in the ground and died , whilst women brought forth short-lived children from beds of blood and pain . Aeron had been the last and least of the four krakens , Balon the eldest and boldest , a fierce and fearless boy who lived only to restore the ironborn to their ancient glory . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's haunted tower . At thirteen he could run a longship 's oars and dance the finger dance as well as any man in the isles . At fifteen he had sailed with Dagmer Cleftjaw to the Stepstones and spent a summer reaving . He slew his first man there and took his first two salt wives . At seventeen Balon captained his own ship . He was all that an elder brother ought to be , though he had never shown Aeron aught but scorn . I was weak and full of sin , and scorn was more than I deserved . Better to be scorned by Balon the Brave than beloved of Euron Crow 's Eye . And if age and grief had turned Balon bitter with the years , they had also made him more determined than any man alive . He was born a lord 's son and died a king , murdered by a jealous god , Aeron thought , and now the storm is coming , a storm such as these isles have never known . <p> It was long after dark by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hammerhorn clawing at the crescent moon . Gorold 's keep was hulking and blocky , its great stones quarried from the cliff that loomed behind it . Below its walls , the entrances of caves and ancient mines yawned like toothless black mouths . The Hammerhorn 's iron gates had been closed and barred for the night . Aeron beat on them with a rock until the clanging woke a guard . <p> The youth who admitted him was the image of Gormond , whose horse he 'd taken . " Which one are you ? " Aeron demanded . <p> " Gran . My father awaits you within . " <p> The hall was dank and drafty , full of shadows . One of Gorold 's daughters offered the priest a horn of ale . Another poked at a sullen fire that was giving off more smoke than heat . Gorold Goodbrother himself was talking quietly with a slim man in fine grey robes , who wore about his neck a chain of many metals that marked him for a maester of the Citadel . <p> " Where is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " He returns afoot . Send your women away , my lord . And the maester as well . " He had no love of maesters . Their ravens were creatures of the Storm God , and he did not trust their healing , not since Urri . No proper man would choose a life of thralldom , nor forge a chain of servitude to wear about his throat . <p> " This is my hall , Damphair . It is not for you to say who must go and who remains . The maester stays . " <p> The man lives too far from the sea , Aeron told himself . " Then I shall go , " he told Goodbrother . Dry rushes rustled underneath the cracked soles of his bare black feet as he turned and stalked away . It seemed he had ridden a long way for naught . <p> Aeron was almost at the door when the maester cleared his throat , and said , " Euron Crow 's Eye sits the Seastone Chair . " <p> The Damphair turned . The hall had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a world away . Balon sent him off two years ago , and swore that it would be his life if he returned . " Tell me , " he said hoarsely . <p> " He sailed into Lordsport the day after the king 's death , and claimed the castle and the crown as Balon 's eldest brother , " said Gorold Goodbrother . " Now he sends forth ravens , summoning the captains and the kings from every isle to Pyke , to bend their knees and do him homage as their king . " <p> " No . " Aeron Damphair did not weigh his words . " Only a godly man may sit the Seastone Chair . The Crow 's Eye worships naught but his own pride . " <p> " You were on Pyke not long ago , and saw the king , " said Goodbrother . " Did Balon say aught to you of the succession ? " <p> Aye . They had spoken in the Sea Tower , as the wind howled outside the windows and the waves crashed restlessly below . Balon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aeron had to tell him of his last remaining son . " The wolves have made a weakling of him , as I feared , " the king had said . " I pray god that they killed him , so he can not stand in Asha 's way . " That was Balon 's blindness ; he saw himself in his wild , headstrong daughter , and believed she could succeed him . He was wrong in that , and Aeron tried to tell him so . " No woman will ever rule the ironborn , not even a woman such as Asha , " he insisted , but Balon could be deaf to things he did not wish to hear . <p> Before the priest could answer Gorold Goodbrother , the maester 's mouth flapped open once again . " By rights the Seastone Chair belongs to Theon , or Asha if the prince is dead . That is the law . " <p> " Green land law , " said Aeron with contempt . " What is that to us ? We are ironborn , the sons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No woman may rule over us , nor any godless man . " <p> Aeron silenced him with a look . In little fishing towns and great stone keeps alike such a look from Damphair would make maids feel faint and send children shrieking to their mothers , and it was more than sufficient to quell the chain-neck thrall . " Euron is elder , " the priest said , " but Victarion is more godly . " <p> " Will it come to war between them ? " asked the maester . <p> " Ironborn must not spill the blood of ironborn . " <p> " A pious sentiment , Damphair , " said Goodbrother , " but not one that your brother shares . He had Sawane Botley drowned for saying that the Seastone Chair by rights belonged to Theon . " <p> " If he was drowned , no blood was shed , " said Aeron . <p> The maester and the lord exchanged a look . " I must send word to Pyke , and soon , " said Gorold Goodbrother . " Damphair , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homage or defiance ? " <p> Aeron tugged his beard , and thought . I have seen the storm , and its name is Euron Crow 's Eye . " For now , send only silence , " he told the lord . " I must pray on this . " <p> " Pray all you wish , " the maester said . " It does not change the law . Theon is the rightful heir , and Asha next . " <p> " Silence ! " Aeron roared . " Too long have the ironborn listened to you chain-neck maesters prating of the green lands and their laws . It is time we listened to the sea again . It is time we listened to the voice of god . " His own voice rang in that smoky hall , so full of power that neither Gorold Goodbrother nor his maester dared a reply . The Drowned God is with me , Aeron thought . He has shown me the way . <p> Goodbrother offered him the comforts of the castle for the night , but the priest declined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never so far from the sea . " Comforts I shall know in the Drowned God 's watery halls beneath the waves . We are born to suffer , that our sufferings might make us strong . All that I require is a fresh horse to carry me to Pebbleton . " <p> That Goodbrother was pleased to provide . He sent his son Greydon as well , to show the priest the shortest way through the hills down to the sea . Dawn was still an hour off when they set forth , but their mounts were hardy and surefooted , and they made good time despite the darkness . Aeron closed his eyes and said a silent prayer , and after a while began to drowse in the saddle . <p> The sound came softly , the scream of a rusted hinge . " Urri , " he muttered , and woke , fearful . There is no hinge here , no door , no Urri . A flying axe took off half of Urri 's hand when he was ten-and-four , playing at the finger dance whilst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Lord Quellon 's third wife had been a Piper of Pinkmaiden Castle , a girl with big soft breasts and brown doe 's eyes . Instead of healing Urri 's hand the Old Way , with fire and seawater , she gave him to her green land maester , who swore that he could sew back the missing fingers . He did that , and later he used potions and poltices and herbs , but the hand mortified and Urri took a fever . By the time the maester sawed his arm off , it was too late . <p> Lord Quellon never returned from his last voyage ; the Drowned God in his goodness granted him a death at sea . It was Lord Balon who came back , with his brothers Euron and Victarion . When Balon heard what had befallen Urri , he removed three of the maester 's fingers with a cook 's cleaver and sent his father 's Piper wife to sew them back on . Poltices and potions worked as well for the maester as they had for Urrigon . He died raving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as the midwife drew a stillborn daughter from her womb . Aeron had been glad . It had been his axe that sheared off Urri 's hand , whilst they danced the finger dance together , as friends and brothers will . <p> It shamed him still to recall the years that followed Urri 's death . At six-and-ten he called himself a man , but in truth he had been a sack of wine with legs . He would sing , he would dance ( but not the finger dance , never again ) , he would jape and jabber and make mock . He played the pipes , he juggled , he rode horses , and could drink more than all the Wynches and the Botleys , and half the Harlaws too . The Drowned God gives every man a gift , even him ; no man could piss longer or farther than Aeron Greyjoy , as he proved at every feast . Once he bet his new longship against a herd of goats that he could quench a hearthfire with no more than his cock . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the longship Golden Storm , though Balon threatened to hang him from her mast when he heard what sort of ram his brother proposed to mount upon her prow . <p> In the end the Golden Storm went down off Fair Isle during Balon 's first rebellion , cut in half by a towering war galley called Fury when Stannis Baratheon caught Victarion in his trap and smashed the Iron Fleet . Yet the god was not done with Aeron , and carried him to shore . Some fishermen took him captive and marched him down to Lannisport in chains , and he spent the rest of the war in the bowels of Casterly Rock , proving that krakens can piss farther and longer than lions , boars , or chickens . <p> That man is dead . Aeron had drowned and been reborn from the sea , the god 's own prophet . No mortal man could frighten him , no more than the darkness could . . . nor memories , the bones of the soul . The sound of a door opening , the scream of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not matter . He was the Damphair priest , beloved of the god . <p> " Will it come to war ? " asked Greydon Goodbrother as the sun was lightening the hills . " A war of brother against brother ? " <p> " If the Drowned God wills it . No godless man may sit the Seastone Chair . " The Crow 's Eye will fight , that is certain . No woman could defeat him , not even Asha ; women were made to fight their battles in the birthing bed . And Theon , if he lived , was just as hopeless , a boy of sulks and smiles . At Winterfell he proved his worth , such that it was , but the Crow 's Eye was no crippled boy . The decks of Euron 's ship were painted red , to better hide the blood that soaked them . Victarion . The king must be Victarion , or the storm will slay us all . <p> Greydon left him when the sun was up , to take the news of Balon 's death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spike Keep , and Corpse Lake . Aeron continued on alone , up hills and down vales along a stony track that drew wider and more traveled as he neared the sea . In every village he paused to preach , and in the yards of petty lords as well . " We were born from the sea , and to the sea we all return , " he told them . His voice was as deep as the ocean , and thundered like the waves . " The Storm God in his wrath plucked Balon from his castle and cast him down , and now he feasts beneath the waves in the Drowned God 's watery halls . " He raised his hands . " Balon is dead ! The king is dead ! Yet a king will come again ! For what is dead may never die , but rises again , harder and stronger ! A king will rise ! " <p> Some of those who heard him threw down their hoes and picks to follow , so by the time he heard the crash of waves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ god and desirous of drowning . <p> Pebbleton was home to several thousand fisherfolk , whose hovels huddled round the base of a square towerhouse with a turret at each corner . Twoscore of Aeron 's drowned men there awaited him , camped along a grey sand beach in sealskin tents and shelters built of driftwood . Their hands were roughened by brine , scarred by nets and lines , callused from oars and picks and axes , but now those hands gripped driftwood cudgels hard as iron , for the god had armed them from his arsenal beneath the sea . <p> They had built a shelter for the priest just above the tideline . Gladly he crawled into it , after he had drowned his newest followers . My god , he prayed , speak to me in the rumble of the waves , and tell me what to do . The captains and the kings await your word . Who shall be our king in Balon 's place ? Sing to me in the language of leviathan , that I may know his name . Tell me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strength to fight the storm on Pyke ? <p> Though his ride to Hammerhorn had left him weary , Aeron Damphair was restless in his driftwood shelter , roofed over with black weeds from the sea . The clouds rolled in to cloak the moon and stars , and the darkness lay as thick upon the sea as it did upon his soul . Balon favored Asha , the child of his body , but a woman can not rule the ironborn . It must be Victarion . Nine sons had been born from the loins of Quellon Greyjoy , and Victarion was the strongest of them , a bull of a man , fearless and dutiful . And therein lies our danger . A younger brother owes obedience to an elder , and Victarion was not a man to sail against tradition . He has no love for Euron , though . Not since the woman died . <p> Outside , beneath the snoring of his drowned men and the keening of the wind , he could hear the pounding of the waves , the hammer of his god @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shelter into the chill of the night . Naked he stood , pale and gaunt and tall , and naked he walked into the black salt sea . The water was icy cold , yet he did not flinch from his god 's caress . A wave smashed against his chest , staggering him . The next broke over his head . He could taste the salt on his lips and feel the god around him , and his ears rang with the glory of his song . Nine sons were born from the loins of Quellon Greyjoy , and I was the least of them , as weak and frightened as a girl . But no longer . That man is drowned , and the god has made me strong . The cold salt sea surrounded him , embraced him , reached down through his weak man 's flesh and touched his bones . Bones , he thought . The bones of the soul . Balon 's bones , and Urri 's . The truth is in our bones , for flesh decays and bone endures . And on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ King 's Hall . . . <p> And gaunt and pale and shivering , Aeron Damphair struggled back to the shore , a wiser man than he had been when he stepped into the sea . For he had found the answer in his bones , and the way was plain before him . The night was so cold that his body seemed to steam as he stalked back toward his shelter , but there was a fire burning in his heart , and sleep came easily for once , unbroken by the scream of iron hinges . <p> When he woke the day was bright and windy . Aeron broke his fast on a broth of clams and seaweed cooked above a driftwood fire . No sooner had he finished than the Merlyn descended from his towerhouse with half a dozen guards to seek him out . " The king is dead , " the Damphair told him . <p> " Aye . I had a bird . And now another .

" Ten Towers was the seat of the Lord of Harlaw . <p> " The Princess Asha . She has set her sails for home . The Reader sends out ravens , summoning all her friends to Harlaw . He says that Balon meant for her to sit the Seastone Chair . " <p> " The Drowned God shall decide who sits the Seastone Chair , " the priest said . " Kneel , that I might bless you .

Bless him with salt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Water ran down Merlyn 's fat cheeks to soak his beard and fox-fur mantle . " What is dead may never die , " Aeron finished , " but rises again , harder and stronger . " But when Merlyn rose , he told him , " Stay and listen , that you may spread god 's word . " <p> Three feet from the water 's edge the waves broke around a rounded granite boulder . It was there that Aeron Damphair stood , so all his school might see him , and hear the words he had to say . <p> " We were born from the sea , and to the sea we all return , " he began , as he had a hundred times before . " The Storm God in his wrath plucked Balon from his castle and cast him down , and now he feasts beneath the waves . " He raised his hands . " The iron king is dead ! Yet a king will come again !

" they cried . " Damphair King ! Aeron King ! Give us Damphair ! " <p> Aeron shook his head . " If a father has two sons and gives to one an axe and to the other a net , which does he intend should be the warrior ? " <p> " The axe is for the warrior , " Rus shouted back , " the net for a fisher of the seas . " <p> " Aye , " said Aeron .

Raise your sails and unship your oars , my lord , and take yourself to Old Wyk . You , and all the captains and the kings . Go not to Pyke , to bow before the godless , nor to Harlaw , to consort with scheming women . Point your prow toward Old Wyk , where stood the Grey King 's Hall . In the name of the Drowned God I summon you . I summon all of you ! Leave your halls and hovels , your castles and your keeps , and return to Nagga 's hill to make a kingsmoot ! " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There has not been a true kingsmoot in . . . " <p> " . . . too long a time ! " Aeron cried in anguish .

It was a kingsmoot that chose Urras Ironfoot for High King , and placed a driftwood crown upon his brows . Sylas Flatnose , Harrag Hoare , the Old Kraken , the kingsmoot raised them all . And from this kingsmoot shall emerge a man to finish the work King Balon has begun and win us back our freedoms . Go not to Pyke , nor to the Ten Towers of Harlaw , but to Old Wyk , I say again . Seek the hill of Nagga and the bones of the Grey King 's Hall , for in that holy place when the moon has drowned and come again we shall make ourselves a worthy king , a godly king . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Listen !

" And the clamor that they made was so thunderous that surely the Crow 's Eye heard the shouts on Pyke , and the vile Storm God in his cloudy hall . And Aeron Damphair knew he had done well .

The woman 's voice , sharp with an accent . Then the man 's . Then another man 's . And another <p> Oh , shit . <p> Heart hammering , he tried to rouse himself . Why was he so tired ? Goddamn it , he had to make a break for it , before he found himself in the middle of a gang bang or- <p> Outside , in the TV room , the woman offered refreshments . Two of the men asked for wine , the third accepted water . Then their voices settled into one place , as if they were sitting . <p> Wine and conversation as a prelude to sex games with a teenage boy ? <p> Brendan strained to make out their words . They were talking about books . " Texts " as they called them , tossing around words like belief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Latin versions . <p> Latin . That 's what the woman had been speaking earlier . As he 'd been getting into their car , she said been saying something to the man in another language , and with her accent , Brendan had figured she was reverting to her mother tongue to relay a private message . The language , though , had sounded familiar . Now he knew why . As a Christmas and Easter Catholic , he 'd heard enough Latin . <p> Now these people were discussing religious texts , and that could n't be a coincidence . The couple had said they wanted to help , as penance for their mistakes with their son . Good Samaritans . <p> " -too old , " one man was saying , his voice rising enough for Brendan to hear him easily . " All of our success has been with kids much younger , and I do n't understand why we need to change that now . " <p> " We are n't changing , " another man said . " We 're expanding and experimenting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there and it 's difficult getting access to them . If we can adjust the procedure to work successfully with teens , we open the door to limitless possibilities . " <p> " Don 's right . " The woman again . " One or two a year is n't enough , not for the scale we " <p> He could n't blame them for setting their sights on children . By his age , most street kids had no interest in " rescue . " They were too immersed in the life to accept help . But he would . Drugs were n't a problem-he 'd never been able to afford them . They could spout all the Bible verses they wanted and he 'd smile and agree if it meant getting on a bus home . He could tell his parents he 'd had n't failed ; he 'd just had a religious experience and had changed his mind . <p> He closed his eyes and pictured himself walking up his drive , imagined his mother 's face , his little sister 's squeals , his father 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to have turned to a heated debate on the nature of suffering . Yeah , he thought with a chuckle , definitely Catholic . From what he could make out , it sounded a hell of a lot like a conversation between two Goths he 'd overheard last week . <p> Morbid . The word popped into his head and he turned it over in his mind . A cool word . Described Goths and some religious types alike-that fixation with death and suffering . <p> In the room beyond , a male voice had picked up volume again . <p> " -Romans used crucifixion not only because it was publicly humiliating , but for the degree of suffering inflicted . With the weight of the body pulling down , breathing becomes difficult , and the condemned could hang for days , slowly suffocating . " <p> " True , but according to accounts of the witch trials , burning was the worst way to die . If you keep the person from dying from smoke inhalation , they can live a surprisingly long time , and suffer unimaginable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went beyond morbid . Maybe these were n't mainstream religious do-gooders , but some kind of fanatical sect . Like the Scientologists or something . Most religious people he knew were good folks , but there were wackos . As much as he wanted to go home , he would n't put up with any kind of sick shit . He should get up , go in there , maybe tell them he 'd changed his mind . But he was so tired . <p> The voices had stopped . Good . He 'd rest for a few more minutes , then sneak out- <p> The door opened . In walked the man and woman , followed by three others : a younger woman , a balding man and a white-haired one . <p> " Hello , Brendan , " said the woman . <p> Brendan struggled to his feet . " I want to leave . " <p> The woman nodded . Then she stepped forward , lifted her hand to her mouth and blew . A cloud of white dust flew into Brendan 's face . He tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Latin again and his knees gave way . The other two men rushed to grab him , each taking an arm , their grips gentle as they helped him to his feet . <p> The men lifted his arms around their shoulders . His eyelids flagged and closed . His feet dragged across the floor as they took him into a second , smaller room . The men exchanged words , then lowered him to the floor . A cold , hard floor . <p> He opened his eyes . There , from high above , a dog stared down at him . A terrier , like his sister 's dog . But there was something wrong <p> Legs . It did n't have any legs . Just a torso and a head perched on the edge of an overhang , watching him . <p> Hallucinating . <p> Drugged ? <p> He should care-knew he should care-but he could n't work up the energy . He squeezed his eyes shut and huddled there , too weak to even think . He heard them talking and he could tell they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words required too much energy , so he just listened to the sound and let it lull him . <p> Liquid splashed onto his back , seeping through his shirt . Cold and wet and stinking of something he should recognize . Then , as he was about to drift off , his wandering brain identified the smell . <p> Gasoline . <p> He snapped awake , panicked , telling his arms and legs to move , his mouth to scream , but nothing obeyed . He cracked open his eyes just enough to see the people filing from the room . The woman stopped in front of him and bent . Her smiling lips parted , saying something reassuring . Then she struck the match . 
@@37756669 @6756669/ <p> An east wind blew through his tangled hair , as soft and fragrant as Cersei 's fingers . He could hear birds singing , and feel the river moving beneath the boat as the sweep of the oars sent them toward the pale pink dawn . After so long in darkness , the world was so sweet that Jaime Lannister felt dizzy . I am alive , and drunk on sunlight . A laugh burst from his lips , sudden as a quail flushed from cover . <p> " Quiet , " the wench grumbled , scowling . Scowls suited her broad homely face better than a smile . Not that Jaime had ever seen her smiling . He amused himself by picturing her in one of Cersei 's silken gowns in place of her studded leather jerkin . As well dress a cow in silk as this one . <p> But the cow could row . Beneath her roughspun brown breeches were calves like cords of wood , and the long muscles of her arms stretched and tightened with each stroke of the oars . Even after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tiring , which was more than could be said for his cousin Ser Cleos , laboring on the other oar . A big strong peasant wench to look at her , yet she speaks like one highborn and wears longsword and dagger . Ah , but can she use them ? Jaime meant to find out , as soon as he rid himself of these fetters . <p> He wore iron manacles on his wrists and a matching pair about his ankles , joined by a length of heavy chain no more than a foot long . " You 'd think my word as a Lannister was not good enough , " he 'd japed as they bound him . He 'd been very drunk by then , thanks to Catelyn Stark . Of their escape from Riverrun , he recalled only bits and pieces . There had been some trouble with the gaoler , but the big wench had overcome him . <p> After that they had climbed an endless stair , around and around . His legs were weak as grass , and he 'd stumbled twice or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lean on . At some point he was bundled into a traveler 's cloak and shoved into the bottom of a skiff . He remembered listening to Lady Catelyn command someone to raise the portcullis on the Water Gate . She was sending Ser Cleos Frey back to King 's Landing with new terms for the queen , she 'd declared in a tone that brooked no argument . <p> He must have drifted off then . The wine had made him sleepy , and it felt good to stretch , a luxury his chains had not permitted him in the cell . Jaime had long ago learned to snatch sleep in the saddle during a march . This was no harder . Tyrion is going to laugh himself sick when he hears how I slept through my own escape . He was awake now , though , and the fetters were irksome . " My lady , " he called out , " if you 'll strike off these chains , I 'll spell you at those oars . " <p> " No . Do you deny your sex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He gave her an innocent smile . " I 'd ask you to open your bodice , but from the look of you that would n't prove much . " <p> Ser Cleos fretted . " Cousin , remember your courtesies . " <p> The Lannister blood runs thin in this one . Cleos was his Aunt Genna 's son by that dullard Emmon Frey , who had lived in terror of Lord Tywin Lannister since the day he wed his sister . When Lord Walder Frey had brought the Twins into the war on the side of Riverrun , Ser Emmon had chosen his wife 's allegiance over his father 's . Casterly Rock got the worst of that bargain , Jaime reflected . Ser Cleos looked like a weasel , fought like a goose , and had the courage of an especially brave ewe . Lady Stark had promised him release if he delivered her message to Tyrion , and Ser Cleos had solemnly vowed to do so . <p> They 'd all done a deal of vowing back in that cell , Jaime most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . She had laid the point of the big wench 's sword against his heart and said , " Swear that you will never again take up arms against Stark nor Tully . Swear that you will compel your brother to honor his pledge to return my daughters safe and unharmed . Swear on your honor as a knight , on your honor as a Lannister , on your honor as a Sworn Brother of the Kingsguard . Swear it by your sister 's life , and your father 's , and your son 's , by the old gods and the new , and I 'll send you back to your sister . Refuse , and I will have your blood . " He remembered the prick of the steel through his rags as she twisted the point of the sword . <p> I wonder what the High Septon would have to say about the sanctity of oaths sworn while dead drunk , chained to a wall , with a sword pressed to your chest ? Not that Jaime was truly concerned about that fat fraud , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pail Lady Catelyn had kicked over in his cell . A strange woman , to trust her girls to a man with shit for honor . Though she was trusting him as little as she dared . She is putting her hope in Tyrion , not in me . " Perhaps she is not so stupid after all , " he said aloud . <p> His captor took it wrong . " I am not stupid . Nor deaf . " <p> He was gentle with her ; mocking this one would be so easy there would be no sport to it . " I was speaking to myself , and not of you . It 's an easy habit to slip into in a cell . " <p> She frowned at him , pushing the oars forward , pulling them back , pushing them forward , saying nothing . <p> As glib of tongue as she is fair of face . " By your speech , I 'd judge you nobly born . " <p> " My father is Selwyn of Tarth , by the grace of the gods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Tarth , " Jaime said . " A ghastly large rock in the narrow sea , as I recall . And Evenfall is sworn to Storm 's End . How is it that you serve Robb of Winterfell ? " <p> " It is Lady Catelyn I serve . And she commanded me to deliver you safe to your brother Tyrion at King 's Landing , not to bandy words with you . Be silent . " <p> " A man who would violate his own sister , murder his king , and fling an innocent child to his death deserves no other name . " <p> Innocent ? The wretched boy was spying on us . All Jaime had wanted was an hour alone with Cersei . Their journey north had been one long torment ; seeing her every day , unable to touch her , knowing that Robert stumbled drunkenly into her bed every night in that great creaking wheelhouse . Tyrion had done his best to keep him in a good humor , but it had not been enough . " You will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . <p> " My name is Brienne , not wench . " <p> " What do you care what a monster calls you ? " <p> " My name is Brienne , " she repeated , dogged as a hound . <p> " Lady Brienne ? " She looked so uncomfortable that Jaime sensed a weakness . " Or would Ser Brienne be more to your taste ? " He laughed . " No , I fear not . You can trick out a milk cow in crupper , crinet , and chamfron , and bard her all in silk , but that does n't mean you can ride her into battle . " <p> " Cousin Jaime , please , you ought not speak so roughly . " Under his cloak , Ser Cleos wore a surcoat quartered with the twin towers of House Frey and the golden lion of Lannister . " We have far to go , we should not quarrel amongst ourselves . " <p> " When I quarrel I do it with a sword , coz . I was speaking to the lady . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tarth as homely as you ? I pity the men , if so . Perhaps they do not know what real women look like , living on a dreary mountain in the sea . " <p> " She 's rude as well , is n't she , coz ? " Jaime asked Ser Cleos . " Though she has steel in her spine , I 'll grant you . Not many men dare name me monster to my face . " Though behind my back they speak freely enough , I have no doubt . <p> Ser Cleos coughed nervously . " Lady Brienne had those lies from Catelyn Stark , no doubt . The Starks can not hope to defeat you with swords , ser , so now they make war with poisoned words . " <p> They did defeat me with swords , you chinless cretin . Jaime smiled knowingly . Men will read all sorts of things into a knowing smile , if you let them . Has cousin Cleos truly swallowed this kettle of dung , or is he striving to ingratiate himself ? What do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> Ser Cleos prattled blithely on . " Any man who 'd believe that a Sworn Brother of the Kingsguard would harm a child does not know the meaning of honor . " <p> Lickspittle . If truth be told , Jaime had come to rue heaving Brandon Stark out that window . Cersei had given him no end of grief afterward , when the boy refused to die . " He was seven , Jaime , " she 'd berated him . " Even if he understood what he saw , we should have been able to frighten him into silence . " <p> " I did n't think you 'd want " <p> " You never think . If the boy should wake and tell his father what he saw " <p> " If if if . " He had pulled her into his lap . " if he wakes we 'll say he was dreaming , we 'll call him a liar , and should worse come to worst I 'll kill Ned Stark . " <p> " And then what do you imagine Robert will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleases . I 'll go to war with him if I must . The War for Cersei 's Cunt , the singers will call it . " <p> " Jaime , let go of me ! " she raged , struggling to rise . <p> Instead he had kissed her . For a moment she resisted , but then her mouth opened under his . He remembered the taste of wine and cloves on her tongue . She gave a shudder . His hand went to her bodice and yanked , tearing the silk so her breasts spilled free , and for a time the Stark boy had been forgotten . <p> Had Cersei remembered him afterward and hired this man Lady Catelyn spoke of , to make sure the boy never woke ? If she wanted him dead she would have sent me . And it is not like her to chose a catspaw who would make such a royal botch of the killing . <p> Downriver , the rising sun shimmered against the wind-whipped surface of the river . The south shore was red clay , smooth as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the rotting trunks of drowned trees clung to the banks . The north shore was wilder . High rocky bluffs rose twenty feet above them , crowned by stands of beech , oak , and chestnut . Jaime spied a watchtower on the heights ahead , growing taller with every stroke of the oars . Long before they were upon it , he knew that it stood abandoned , its weathered stones overgrown with climbing roses . <p> When the wind shifted , Ser Cleos helped the big wench run up the sail , a stiff triangle of striped red-and-blue canvas . Tully colors , sure to cause them grief if they encountered any Lannister forces on the river , but it was the only sail they had . Brienne took the rudder . Jaime threw out the leeboard , his chains rattling as he moved . After that , they made better speed , with wind and current both favoring their flight . " We could save a deal of traveling if you delivered me to my father instead of my brother , " he pointed out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Landing . I will return with the girls or not at all . " <p> Jaime turned to Ser Cleos . " Cousin , lend me your knife . " <p> " No . " The woman tensed . " I will not have you armed . " Her voice was as unyielding as stone . <p> She fears me , even in irons . " Cleos , it seems I must ask you to shave me . Leave the beard , but take the hair off my head . " <p> " You 'd be shaved bald ? " asked Cleos Frey . <p> " The realm knows Jaime Larmister as a beardless knight with long golden hair . A bald man with a filthy yellow beard may pass unnoticed . I 'd sooner not be recognized while I 'm in irons . " <p> The dagger was not as sharp as it might have been . Cleos hacked away manfully , sawing and ripping his way through the mats and tossing the hair over the side . The golden curls floated on the surface of the water , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ louse went crawling down his neck . Jaime caught it and crushed it against his thumbnail . Ser Cleos picked others from his scalp and flicked them into the water . Jaime doused his head and made Ser Cleos whet the blade before he let him scrape away the last inch of yellow stubble . When that was done , they trimmed back his beard as well . <p> The reflection in the water was a man he did not know . Not only was he bald , but he looked as though he had aged five years in that dungeon ; his face was thinner , with hollows under his eyes and lines he did not remember . I do n't look as much like Cersei this way . She 'll hate that . <p> By midday , Ser Cleos had fallen asleep . His snores sounded like ducks mating . Jaime stretched out to watch the world flow past ; after the dark cell , every rock and tree was a wonder . <p> A few one-room shacks came and went , perched on tall poles that made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there they saw no sign . Birds flew overhead , or cried out from the trees along the shore , and Jaime glimpsed silvery fish knifing through the water . Tully trout , there 's a bad omen , he thought , until he saw a worseone of the floating logs they passed turned out to be a dead man , bloodless and swollen . His cloak was tangled in the roots of a fallen tree , its color unmistakably Lannister crimson . He wondered if the corpse had been someone he knew . <p> The forks of the Trident were the easiest way to move goods or men across the riverlands . In times of peace , they would have encountered fisherfolk in their skiffs , grain barges being poled downstream , merchants selling needles and bolts of cloth from floating shops , perhaps even a gaily painted mummer 's boat with quilted sails of half a hundred colors , making its way upriver from village to village and castle to castle . <p> But the war had taken its toll . They sailed past villages , but saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hanging from some trees , was the only sign of fisherfolk . A young girl watering her horse rode off as soon as she glimpsed their sail . Later they passed a dozen peasants digging in a field beneath the shell of a burnt towerhouse . The men gazed at them with dull eyes , and went back to their labors once they decided the skiff was no threat . <p> The Red Fork was wide and slow , a meandering river of loops and bends dotted with tiny wooded islets and frequently choked by sandbars and snags that lurked just below the water 's surface . Brienne seemed to have a keen eye for the dangers , though , and always seemed to find the channel . When Jaime complimented her on her knowledge of the river , she looked at him suspiciously and said , " I do not know the river . Tarth is an island . I learned to manage oars and sail before I ever sat a horse . " <p> Ser Cleos sat up and rubbed at his eyes . " Gods , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He sniffed at it . " I smell rain . " <p> Jaime would welcome a good rain . The dungeons of Riverrun were not the cleanest place in the Seven Kingdoms . By now he must smell like an overripe cheese . <p> Cleos squinted downriver . " Smoke . " <p> A thin grey finger crooked them on . It was rising from the south bank several miles on , twisting and curling . Below , Jaime made out the smouldering remains of a large building , and a live oak full of dead women . <p> The crows had scarcely started on their corpses . The thin ropes cut deeply into the soft flesh of their throats , and when the wind blew they twisted and swayed . " This was not chivalrously done , " said Brienne when they were close enough to see it clearly . " No true knight would condone such wanton butchery . " <p> " True knights see worse every time they ride to war , wench , " said Jaime . " And do worse , yes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'll leave no innocents to be food for crows . " <p> " A heartless wench . Crows need to eat as well . Stay to the river and leave the dead alone , woman . " <p> They landed upstream of where the great oak leaned out over the water . As Brienne lowered the sail , Jaime climbed out , clumsy in his chains . The Red Fork filled his boots and soaked through the ragged breeches . Laughing , he dropped to his knees , plunged his head under the water , and came up drenched and dripping . His hands were caked with dirt , and when he rubbed them clean in the current they seemed thinner and paler than he remembered . His legs were stiff as well , and unsteady when he put his weight upon them . I was too bloody long in Hoster Tully 's dungeon . <p> Brienne and Cleos dragged the skiff onto the bank . The corpses hung above their heads , ripening in death like foul fruit . " One of us will need to cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wench was staring up at one of the dead women . Jaime shuffled closer with small stutter steps , the only kind the foot-long chain permitted . When he saw the crude sign hung about the neck of the highest corpse , he smiled . " They Lay With Lions , " he read . " Oh , yes , woman , this was most unchivalrously done . . . But by your side , not mine . I wonder who they were , these women ? " <p> " Tavern wenches , " said Ser Cleos Frey . " This was an inn , I remember it now . Some men of my escort spent the night here when we last returned to Riverrun . " Nothing remained of the building but the stone foundation and a tangle of collapsed beams , charred black . Smoke still rose from the ashes . <p> Jaime left brothels and whores to his brother Tyrion ; Cersei was the only woman he had ever wanted . " The girls pleasured some of my lord father 's soldiers , it would seem . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they earned their traitors ' collars , with a kiss and a cup of ale . " He glanced up and down the river , to make certain they were quite alone . " This is Bracken land . Lord Jonos might have ordered them killed . My father burned his castle , I fear he loves us not . " <p> " It might be Marq Piper 's work , " said Ser Cleos . " Or that wisp o ' the wood Beric Dondarrion , though I 'd heard he kills only soldiers . Perhaps a band of Roose Bolton 's northmen ? " <p> " Bolton was defeated by my father on the Green Fork . " <p> " But not broken , " said Ser Cleos . " He came south again when Lord Tywin marched against the fords . The word at Riverrun was that he 'd taken Harrenhal from Ser Amory Lorch . " <p> Jaime liked the sound of that not at all . " Brienne , " he said , granting her the courtesy of the name in the hopes that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both the Trident and the kingsroad are likely watched . " <p> He thought he saw a touch of uncertainty in her big blue eyes . " You are under my protection . They 'd need to kill me . " <p> " I should n't think that would trouble them . " <p> " I am as good a fighter as you , " she said defensively . " I was one of King Renly 's chosen seven . With his own hands , he cloaked me with the striped silk of the Rainbow Guard . " <p> " The Rainbow Guard ? You and six other girls , was it ? A singer once said that all maids are fair in silk . . . But he never met you , did he ? " <p> The woman turned red . " We have graves to dig . " She went to climb the tree . <p> The lower limbs of the oak were big enough for her to stand upon once she 'd gotten up the trunk . She walked amongst the leaves , dagger in hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bodies as they fell , and the stench grew worse with each one she dropped . " This is a deal of trouble to take for whores , " Ser Cleos complained . " What are we supposed to dig with ? We have no spades , and I will not use my sword , I " <p> Brienne gave a shout . She jumped down rather than climbing . " To the boat . Be quick . There 's a sail . " <p> They made what haste they could , though Jaime could hardly run , and had to be pulled back up into the skiff by his cousin . Brienne shoved off with an oar and raised sail hurriedly . " Ser Cleos , I 'll need you to row as well . " <p> He did as she bid . The skiff began to cut the water a bit faster ; current , wind , and oars all worked for them . Jaime sat chained , peering upriver . Only the top of the other sail was visible . With the way the Red Fork looped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ north behind a screen of trees while they moved south , but he knew that was deceptive . He lifted both hands to shade his eyes . " Mud red and watery blue , " he announced . <p> Brienne 's big mouth worked soundlessly , giving her the look of a cow chewing its cud . " Faster , ser . " <p> The inn soon vanished behind them , and they lost sight of the top of the sail as well , but that meant nothing . Once the pursuers swung around the loop they would become visible again . " We can hope the noble Tullys will stop to bury the dead whores , I suppose . " The prospect of returning to his cell did not appeal to Jaime . Tyrion could think of something clever now , but all that occurs to me is to go at them with a sword . <p> For the good part of an hour they played peek-and-seek with the pursuers , sweeping around bends and between small wooded isles . Just when they were starting to hope that somehow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sail became visible again . Ser Cleos paused in his stroke . " The Others take them . " He wiped sweat from his brow . <p> " Row ! " Brienne said . <p> " That is a river galley coming after us , " Jaime announced after he 'd watched for a while . With every stroke , it seemed to grow a little larger . " Nine oars on each side , which means eighteen men . More , if they crowded on fighters as well as rowers . And larger sails than ours . We can not outrun her . " <p> Ser Cleos froze at his oars . " Eighteen , you said ? " <p> " Six for each of us . I 'd want eight , but these bracelets hinder me somewhat . " Jaime held up his wrists . " Unless the Lady Brienne would be so kind as to unshackle me ? " <p> She ignored him , putting all her effort into her stroke . <p> " We had half a night 's start on them , " Jaime said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two oars at a time . They 'll be exhausted . Just now the sight of our sail has given them a burst of strength , but that will not last . We ought to be able to kill a good many of them . " <p> Ser Cleos gaped . " But . . . There are eighteen . " <p> " At the least . More likely twenty or twenty-five . " <p> His cousin groaned . " We ca n't hope to defeat eighteen . " <p> " Did I say we could ? The best we can hope for is to die with swords in our hands . " He was perfectly sincere . Jaime Lannister had never been afraid of death . <p> Brienne broke off rowing . Sweat had stuck strands of her flax-colored hair to her forehead , and her grimace made her look homelier than ever . " You are under my protection , " she said , her voice so thick with anger that it was almost a growl . <p> He had to laugh at such fierceness . She 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be , if she had any teats to speak of . " Then protect me , wench . Or free me to protect myself . " <p> The galley was skimming downriver , a great wooden dragonfly . The water around her was churned white by the furious action of her oars . She was gaining visibly , the men on her deck crowding forward as she came on . Metal glinted in their hands , and Jaime could see bows as well . Archers . He hated archers . <p> At the prow of the onrushing galley stood a stocky man with a bald head , bushy grey eyebrows , and brawny arms . Over his mail he wore a soiled white surcoat with a weeping willow embroidered in pale green , but his cloak was fastened with a silver trout . Riverrun 's captain of guards . In his day Ser Robin Ryger had been a notably tenacious fighter , but his day was done ; he was of an age with Hoster Tully , and had grown old with his lord . <p> When the boats were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth and shouted back over the water . " Come to wish me godspeed , Ser Robin ? " <p> " Come to take you back , Kingslayer , " Ser Robin Ryger bellowed . " How is it that you 've lost your golden hair ? " <p> " I hope to blind my enemies with the sheen off my head . It 's worked well enough for you . " <p> Ser Robin was unamused . The distance between skiff and galley had shrunk to forty yards . " Throw your oars and your weapons into the river , and no one need be harmed . " <p> Jaime told him , for all the good it did . " Catelyn Stark does not rule in Riverrun , " Ser Robin shouted back . Four archers crowded into position on either side of him , two standing and two kneeling . " Cast your swords into the water . " <p> " I have no sword , " he returned , " but if I did , I 'd stick it through your belly and hack the balls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrows answered him . One thudded into the mast , two pierced the sail , and the fourth missed Jaime by a foot . <p> Another of the Red Fork 's broad loops loomed before them . Brienne angled the skiff across the bend . The yard swung as they turned , their sail cracking as it filled with wind . Ahead a large island sat in midstream . The main channel flowed right . To the left a cutoff ran between the island and the high bluffs of the north shore . Brienne moved the tiller and the skiff sheared left , sail rippling . Jaime watched her eyes . Pretty eyes , he thought , and calm . He knew how to read a man 's eyes . He knew what fear looked like . She is determined , not desperate . <p> Thirty yards behind , the galley was entering the bend . " Ser Cleos , take the tiller , " the wench commanded . " Kingslayer , take an oar and keep us off the rocks .

They crossed the head of the island and turned sharply down the cutoff , sending a wash of water against the face of the bluff as the boat tilted . The island was densely wooded , a tangle of willows , oaks , and tall pines that cast deep shadows across the rushing water , hiding snags and the rotted trunks of drowned trees . To their left the bluff rose sheer and rocky , and at its foot the river foamed whitely around broken boulders and tumbles of rock fallen from the cliff face . <p> They passed from sunlight into shadow , hidden from the galley 's view between the green wall of the trees and the stony grey-brown bluff . A few moments ' respite from the arrows , Jaime thought , pushing them off a half-submerged boulder . <p> The skiff rocked . He heard a soft splash , and when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he spied her again , pulling herself from the water at the base of the bluff .

" <p> They could see the sail moving behind the trees . The river galley came into full view at the top of the cutoff , twenty-five yards behind . Her bow swung hard as she came around , and a half-dozen arrows took flight , but all went well wide . The motion of the two boats was giving the archers difficulty , but Jaime knew they 'd soon enough learn to compensate . Brienne was halfway up the cliff face , pulling herself from handhold to handhold . Ryger 's sure to see her , and once he does he 'll have those bowmen bring her down . Jaime decided to see if the old man 's pride would make him stupid . " Ser Robin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Ser Robin raised a hand , and his archers lowered their bows . " Say what you will , Kingslayer , but say it quickly . " <p> The skiff swung through a litter of broken stones as Jaime called out , " I know a better way to settle thissingle combat . You and I. " <p> " I was not born this morning , Lannister . " <p> " No , but you 're like to die this afternoon . " Jaime raised his hands so the other could see the manacles . " I 'll fight you in chains . What could you fear ? " <p> " Not you , ser . If the choice were mine , I 'd like nothing better , but I am commanded to bring you back alive if possible . Bowmen . " He signaled them on . " Notch .

Small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and made splashes on both sides of the bow . Those who had wits enough to understand raised their eyes just as a boulder the size of a cow detached itself from the top of the bluff . Ser Robin shouted in dismay . The stone tumbled through the air , struck the face of the cliff , cracked in two , and smashed down on them . The larger piece snapped the mast , tore through the sail , sent two of the archers flying into the river , and crushed the leg of a rower as he bent over his oar . The rapidity with which the galley began to fill with water suggested that the smaller fragment had punched right through her hull . The oarsman 's screams echoed off the bluff while the archers flailed wildly in the current . From the way they were splashing , neither man could swim . Jaime laughed . <p> By the time they emerged from the cutoff , the galley was foundering amongst pools , eddies , and snags , and Jaime Lannister had decided that the gods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a long wet walk back to Riverrun , and he was rid of the big homely wench as well . I could not have planned it better myself . Once I 'm free of these irons . . . <p> Ser Cleos raised a shout . When Jaime looked up , Brienne was lumbering along the clifftop , well ahead of them , having cut across a finger of land while they were following the bend in the river . She threw herself off the rock , and looked almost graceful as she folded into a dive . It would have been ungracious to hope that she would smash her head on a stone . Ser Cleos turned the skiff toward her . Thankfully , Jaime still had his oar . One good swing when she comes paddling up and I 'll be free of her . <p> Instead he found himself stretching the oar out over the water . Brienne grabbed hold , and Jaime pulled her in . As he helped her into the skiff , water ran from her hair and dripped from her sodden clothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wet . Who would have thought it possible ? " You 're a bloody stupid wench , " he told her . " We could have sailed on without you . I suppose you expect me to thank you ? " <p> " I want none of your thanks , Kingslayer .

@@37756671 @6756671/ <p> Renald Fanwar sat on his porch , warming the sturdy blackoak chair crafted for him by his grandson two years before . He stared northward . <p> At the black and silver clouds . <p> He 'd never seen their like before . They blanketed the entire horizon to the north , high in the sky . They were n't gray . They were black and silver . Dark , rumbling thunderheads , as dark as a root cellar at midnight . With striking silver light breaking between them , flashes of lightning that gave off no sound . <p> The air was thick . Thick with the scents of dust and dirt . Of dried leaves and rain that refused to fall . Spring had come . And yet his crops did n't grow . Not a sprout had dared poke through the earth . <p> He rose slowly from his chair , wood creaking , chair rocking softly behind him , and walked up to the edge of the porch . He chewed on his pipe , though its fire had gone out . He could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . They were so black . Like the smoke of a brushfire , only no brushfire smoke ever rose that high up in the air . And what to make of silver clouds ? Bulging between the black ones , like places where polished steel shone through metal crusted with soot . <p> He rubbed his chin , glancing down at his yard . A small , whitewashed fence contained a patch of grass and shrubs . The shrubs were dead now , every one of them . Had n't lasted through that winter . He 'd need to pull them out soon . And the grass . . . well , the grass was still just winter thatch . Not even any weeds sprouted . <p> A clap of thunder shook him . Pure , sharp , like an enormous crash of metal against metal . It rattled the windows of the house , shook the porch boards , seemed to vibrate his very bones . <p> He jumped back . That strike had been closeperhaps on his property . He itched to go inspect the damage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his land . Up here in the Borderlands , so many things were unintentional tinderdry grass , dry shingles , dry seed . <p> But the clouds were still distant . That strike could n't have been on his property . The silver and black thunderheads rolled and boiled , feeding and consuming themselves . <p> He closed his eyes , calming himself , taking a deep breath . Had he imagined the thunder ? Was he going off the side , as Gaffin always joked ? He opened his eyes . <p> And the clouds were right there , directly above his house . <p> It was as if they had suddenly rolled forward , intending to strike while his gaze was averted . They dominated the sky now , sweeping distantly in either direction , massive and overwhelming . He could almost feel their weight pressing the air down around him . He drew in a breath that was heavy with sudden humidity , and his brow prickled with sweat . <p> Those clouds churned , dark black and silver thunderheads shaking with white blasts . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twister , coming for him . He cried out , raising a hand , as a man might before a powerfully bright light . That blackness . That endless , suffocating blackness . It would take him . He knew . <p> And then the clouds were gone . <p> His pipe hit the porch 's floorboards , clicking softly , tossing burned tabac out in a spray across the steps . He had n't realized he 'd let it slip free . Renald hesitated , looking up at empty blue sky , realizing that he was cringing at nothing . <p> The clouds were off on the horizon again , some forty leagues distant . They thundered softly . <p> He picked up his pipe with a shaking hand , spotted from age , tanned from years spent in the sun . Just a trick of your mind , Renald , he told himself . You 're going off the side , sure as eggs is eggs . <p> He was on edge because of the crops . That had him on edge . Though he spoke optimistic words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Something should have sprouted by now . He 'd farmed that land for forty years ! Barley did n't take this long to sprout . Burn him , but it did n't . What was going on in the world these days ? Plants could n't be depended on to sprout , and clouds did n't stay where they should . <p> He forced himself to sit back down in his chair , legs shaking . Getting old , I am. ... he thought . <p> He 'd worked a farm all of his life . Farmsteading in the Borderlands was not easy , but if you worked hard , you could grow a successful life while you grew strong crops . " A man has as much luck as he has seeds in the field , " his father had always said . <p> Well , Renald was one of the most successful farmers in the area . He 'd done well enough to buy out the two farms beside his , and he could run thirty wagons to market each fall . He now had six good men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fences . Not that he did n't have to climb down in the muck every day and show them what good farming was all about . You could n't let a little success ruin you . <p> Yes , he 'd worked the land , lived the land , as his father always used to say . He understood the weather as well as a man could . Those clouds were n't natural . They rumbled softly , like an animal growling on a dark night . Waiting . Lurking in the nearby woods . <p> He jumped at another crash of thunder that seemed too close . Were those clouds forty leagues away ? Is that what he 'd thought ? Looked more like ten leagues away , now that he studied them . <p> " Do n't get like that , " he grumbled at himself . His own voice sounded good to him . Real . It was nice to hear something other than that rumbling and the occasional creak of shutters in the wind . Should n't he be able to hear Auaine inside , getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's it . Tired . " He fished in his vest pocket and pulled out his tabac pouch . <p> A faint rumbling came from the right . At first , he assumed it was the thunder . However , this rumbling was too grating , too regular . That was n't thunder . It was wheels turning . <p> Sure enough , a large , oxen-drawn wagon crested Mallard 's Hill , just to the east . Renald had named that hill himself . Every good hill needed a name . The road was Mallard 's Road . So why not name the hill that too ? <p> He leaned forward in his chair , pointedly ignoring those clouds as he squinted toward the wagon , trying to make out the driver 's face . Thulin ? The smith ? What was he doing , driving a wagon laden halfway to the heavens ? He was supposed to be working on Renald 's new plow ! <p> Lean for one of his trade , Thulin was still twice as muscled as most farmhands . He had the dark hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face shaved after their fashion , but he did not wear the topknot . Thulin 's family might trace its roots back to Borderland warriors , but he himself was just a simple country man like the rest of them . He ran the smithy over in Oak Water , five miles to the east . Renald had enjoyed many a game of stones with the smith during winter evenings . <p> Thulin was getting onhe had n't seen as many years as Renald , but the last few winters had prompted Thulin to start speaking of retirement . Smithing was n't an old man 's trade . Of course , neither was farming . Were there really any old man 's trades ? <p> Thulin 's wagon approached along the packed earthen road , approaching Renald 's white-fenced yard . Now , that 's odd , Renald thought . Behind the wagon trailed a neat string of animals : five goats and two milkcows . Crates of black-feathered chickens were tied on the outside of the wagon , and the bed of the wagon itself was piled full of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mirala , sat on the seat with him , next to his wife , a golden-haired woman from the south . Twenty-five years Thulin 's wife , but Renald still thought of Gallanha as " that southern girl . " <p> The whole family was in the wagon , leading their best livestock . Obviously on the move . But where ? Off to visit relatives , perhaps ? He and Thulin had n't played a round of stones in ... oh , three weeks now . Not much time for visiting , what with the coming of spring and the hurried planting . Someone would need to mend the plows and sharpen the scythes . Who would do it if Thulin 's smithy went cold ? <p> Renald tucked a pinch of tabac into his pipe as Thulin pulled the wagon up beside Renald 's yard . The lean , gray-haired smith handed the reins to his daughter , then climbed down from the wagon , feet throwing puffs of dust into the air when he hit the ground . Behind him the distant storm still brewed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to the porch . He looked distracted . Renald opened his mouth to give greeting , but Thulin spoke first . <p> " I buried my best anvil in Gallanha 's old strawberry patch , Renald , " the big smith said . " You remember where that is , do n't you ? I packed my best set of tools there as well . They 're well greased and inside my best chest , lined to keep it dry . That should keep the rust off of them . For a time at least . " <p> Renald closed his mouth , holding his pipe half-full . If Thulin was burying his anvil . . . well , it meant he was n't planning to come back for a while . " Thulin , what " <p> " If I do n't return , " Thulin said , glancing northward , " would you dig my things out and see that they 're cared for ? Sell them to someone who cares , Renald . I would n't have just anyone beating that anvil . Took me twenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " But Thulin ! " Renald sputtered . " Where are you going ? " <p> Thulin turned back to him , leaning one arm on the porch railing , those brown eyes of his solemn . " There 's a storm coming , " he said . " And so I figure I 've got to head on to the north . " <p> " Storm ? " Renald asked . " That one on the horizon , you mean ? Thulin , it looks badburn my bones , but it doesbut there 's no use running from it . We 've had bad storms before . " <p> " Not like this , old friend , " Thulin said . " This ai n't the sort of storm you ignore . " <p> " Thulin ? " Renald asked . " What are you talking about ? " <p> Before he could answer , Gallanha called from the wagon box . " Did you tell him about the pots ? " <p> " Ah , " Thulin said . " Gallanha polished up that set of copper-bottom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the kitchen table , waiting for Auaine , if she wants to go claim them . " With that , Thulin nodded to Renald and began to walk back toward the wagon . <p> Renald sat , stupefied . Thulin always had been a blunt one ; he favored saying his mind , then moving on . That was part of what Renald liked about him . But the smith could also pass through a conversation like a boulder rolling through a flock of sheep , leaving everyone dazed . <p> Renald scrambled up , leaving his pipe on the chair and following Thulin down into the yard and to the wagon . Burn it , Renald thought , glancing to the sides , noticing the brown grass and dead shrubs again . He 'd worked hard on that yard . <p> The smith was checking on the chicken crates tied to the sides of his vehicle . Renald caught up to him , reaching out a hand , but Gallanha distracted him . <p> " Here , Renald , " she said from the wagon box . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eggs , one lock of golden hair straying from her bun . Renald reached over to take the basket . " Give these to Auaine . I know you 're short on chickens on account of those foxes last fall . " <p> Renald took the basket of eggs . Some were white , some were brown . " Yes , but where are you going , Gallanha ? " <p> " Please , " Renald said , gesturing with the basket of eggs . " At least take a few minutes . Auaine just put some bread in , one of those thick honey loaves that you like . We can discuss this over a game of stones . " <p> Thulin hesitated . <p> " We 'd better be on the move , " Gallanha said softly . " That storm is coming . " <p> Thulin nodded , then climbed up into the wagon . " You might want to come north too , Renald . If you do , bring everything you can . " He paused . " You 're good enough with the tools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take your best scythes and turn them into polearms . Your two best scythes ; now do n't go skimping around with anything that 's a second best or a third best . Get your best , because it 's the weapon you 're going to use . " <p> Renald frowned . " How do you know that there will be an army ? Thulin , burn me , I 'm no soldier ! " <p> Thulin continued as if he had n't heard the comments . " With a polearm you can pull somebody off of a horse and stab them . And , as I think about it , maybe you can take the third best and make yourself a couple of swords . " <p> " What do I know about making a sword ? Or about using a sword , for that matter ? " <p> " You can learn , " Thulin said , turning north . " Everyone will be needed , Renald . Everyone . They 're coming for us . " He glanced back at Renald . " A sword really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a scythe blade and straighten it out , then you find yourself a piece of wood to act as a guard , to keep the enemy 's blade from sliding down and cutting your hand . Mostly you 'll just be using things that you 've already got . " <p> Renald blinked . He stopped asking questions , but he could n't stop thinking them . They bunched up inside his brain like cattle all trying to force their way through a single gate . <p> " Bring all your stock , Renald , " Thulin said . " You 'll eat themor your men will eat themand you 'll want the milk . And if you do n't , then there 'll be men you can trade with for beef or mutton . Food will be scarce , what with everything spoiling so much and the winter stores having run low . Bring everything you 've got . Dried beans , dried fruit , everything .

I 'm a Borderlander . And that storm means the end is coming , Renald . We need to be there when it arrives . " He stopped , then turned and looked to the north , watching those building clouds as a farmhand might watch a poisonous snake he found in the middle of the field . " Light preserve us , my friend . We need to be there . "

@@37756674 @6756674/ <p> Anyone who had ever read a novel knew that governesses were supposed to be meek and downtrodden . They were also supposed to be quiet , subservient , and obedient , not to mention deferential to the master of the house . Leo , Lord Ramsay , wondered in exasperation why they could n't have gotten one of those . Instead the Hathaway family had hired Catherine Marks , who , in Leos opinion , cast an unflattering shadow upon the entire profession . <p> It was n't that Leo found fault with Markss actual abilities . She had done an excellent job of instructing his two youngest sisters , Poppy and Beatrix , in the finer points of social etiquette . And they had needed an inordinate amount of help , since none of the Hathaways had ever expected to mingle in the upper circles of British society . They had been reared in a strictly middle-class environment , in a village west of London . Their father , Edward Hathaway , had been a medieval history scholar , considered a man of good blood but hardly an aristocrat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Leo had inherited the title of Lord Ramsay . Although he had trained to be an architect , he was now a viscount with land and tenants . The Hathaways had moved to the Ramsay estate in Hampshire , where they had struggled to adjust to the demands of their new life . <p> One of the greatest challenges for the Hathaway sisters had been to learn the absurd multitude of rules and graces expected of privileged young ladies . Had it not been for Catherine Markss patient instruction , the Hathaways would have rampaged through London with all the finesse of stampeding elephants . Marks had done wonders for all of them , especially Beatrix , who was undoubtedly the most eccentric sister of an already eccentric family . Although Beatrix was happiest romping through the meadows and woods like a wild creature , Marks had managed to impress on her that a different code of behavior was required in the ballroom . She had even written a series of etiquette poems for the girls , with such literary gems as : <p> Young ladies must display restraint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or complaints <p> Put our reputations in danger <p> Naturally Leo had n't  been able to resist mocking Markss poetic abilities , but he had to admit privately that her methods had worked . Poppy and Beatrix had successfully navigated a London season , at last . And Poppy had recently married a hotelier named Harry Rutledge . <p> Now only Beatrix was left . Marks had assumed the role of chaperone and companion to the energetic nineteen-year-old . As far as the rest of the Hathaways were concerned , Catherine Marks was practically a member of the family . <p> Leo , for his part , could n't abide the woman . She aired her opinions at will and dared to give orders to him . On the rare occasions when Leo tried to be friendly , she snapped at him or turned away in scorn . When he stated a perfectly rational opinion , he could hardly finish a sentence before Marks had listed all the reasons why he was wrong . <p> Faced with the immutable fact of her dislike , Leo couldnt help but respond in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to convince himself that it did n't  matter if she despised him . There were many women in London who were infinitely more beautiful , engaging , and appealing than Catherine Marks . <p> If only she did n't  fascinate him so . <p> Perhaps it was the secrets she guarded so zealously . Marks never talked about her childhood or her family , or why she had taken a position with the Hathaways . She had taught at a girls school for a short time , but she refused to discuss her academic tenure or explain why she had left . There were rumors , passed on by former students , that she might have been a poor relation of the headmistress , or that she was a fallen woman whose loss of status had obliged her to go into service . <p> Marks was so self-contained and tenacious that it was often easy to forget she was still a young woman in her early twenties . When Leo had first met her , she had been the perfect embodiment of a dried-up spinster , with her spectacles and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her spine was as unbending as a fireplace poker , and her hair , the dull brown of apple moths , was always pinned back too tightly .

She had filled out , her body slender but no longer matchstick thin , and her cheeks had gained color . A week and a half ago , when Leo had arrived from London , he had been absolutely astonished to see Marks with light golden locks . Apparently she had been dyeing her hair for years , but after an error on the part of the apothecary , she had been forced to abandon the disguise . And whereas the darker brown locks had been too severe for her delicate features and pale skin , her own natural blond was stunning . <p> Which had left Leo to grapple with the fact that Catherine Marks , his mortal enemy , was a beauty . It was n't really the altered hair color that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was so uncomfortable without it . She felt vulnerable , and it showed . As a result , Leo wanted to strip away more layers , literal and physical . He wanted to know her . <p> Leo had tried to keep his distance while he pondered the ramifications of this discovery . He was confounded by his familys reaction to Marks , which amounted to nothing more than a collective shrug . Why werent any of them even a fraction as curious about her as he was ? Why had Marks deliberately made herself unattractive for so long ? What the devil was she hiding from ? <p> On a sunny Hampshire afternoon when Leo had ascertained that most of the family was otherwise occupied , he went in search of Marks , reasoning that if he confronted her in private , he would get some answers . He found her outside in a hedged garden filled with flowers . She occupied a bench at the side of a graveled path .

At least , before today . <p> " She 's pregnant . " The words slipped past his lips in a frozen statement of disapproval .

Rounded eyes , parted pink lips , her breathing harsh . And a hint of fear in those eyes . <p> She should have known fear well before she made it here . <p> Using his foot , he pushed the single chair toward her . <p> " Sit , " he growled , deliberately letting the animal he was rumble in his voice . <p> But did she run ?

The driver glanced back at us , Agia said , " The landing for the Botanic Gardens , " and we jolted off . " So dying does n't bother you - that 's refreshing . " <p> I braced myself with a hand on the back of the driver 's bench . " Surely that 's not unusual . There must be thousands , and perhaps millions of people like me . People accustomed to death , who feel that the only part of their lives that really mattered is over . " <p> The sun was now just above the tallest spires , and the flooding light that turned the dusty pavement to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my sabretache there was the tale of an angel ( perhaps actually one of the winged women warriors who are said to serve the Autarch ) who , coming to Urth on some petty mission or other , was struck by a child 's arrow and died . With her gleaming robes all dyed by her heart 's blood even as the boulevards were stained by the expiring life of the sun , she encountered Gabriel himself . His sword blazed in one hand , his great two-headed ax swung in the other , and across his back , suspended on the rainbow , hung the very battle horn of Heaven . " Where wend you , little one , " asked Gabriel , " with your breast more scarlet than the robin 's ? " <p> " I am killed , " the angel said , " and I return to merge my substance once more with the Pancreator . " <p> " Do not be absurd . You are an angel , a pure spirit , and can not die .

Taste my breath - is it not fetid , foul , and nidorous ? " Gabriel answered nothing , and at last the angel said , " Brother and better , even if I have not convinced you with all my proofs , I pray you stand aside . I would rid the universe of my presence . " <p> " I am convinced indeed , " Gabriel said , stepping from the other 's way . " It is only that I was thinking that had I known we might perish , I would not at all times have been so bold .

But I have made my decisions now , and there 's nothing more to say or do . This afternoon the Septentrion will kill me with what ? A plant ? A flower ? In some way I do n't understand . A short time ago , I thought I could go to a place called Thrax and live there whatever life there was to be lived . Well , last night I roomed with a giant . One is not more fantastical than the other . " <p> She did not reply , and after a time I asked , " What is that building over there ? The one with the vermilion roof and the forked columns ? I think there 's allspice pounded in the mortar . At least , I smell something of that sort from it . " <p> " The mensal of the monachs . Do you know you are a frightening man ?

I wanted her to be more experienced than I ; and though I did not for an instant think myself pure , I wished to think her less pure still . <p> " But there is something more to you after all . You have the face of someone who stands to inherit two palatinates and an isle somewhere I never heard of , and the manners of a shoemaker , and when you say you 're not afraid to die , you think you mean it , and under that you believe you do n't . But you do , at the very bottom . It would n't bother you a bit to chop off my head either , would it ? " <p> Around us swirled traffic of every sort : machines , wheeled and wheelless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ riders on the backs of dromedaries , oxen , metamynodons , and hackneys . Now an open fiacre like our own drew up beside us . Agia leaned toward the couple it carried and shouted , " We 'll distance you ! " <p> " Where bound ? " the man called back , and I recognized Sieur Racho , whom I had once met when I had been sent to Master Ultan for books . <p> I gripped Agia by the arm . " Are you mad , or is he ? " <p> " The Garden Landing , for a chrisos ! " <p> The other vehicle tore away with ours behind it . " Faster ! " Agia shouted to our driver . Then to me : " Have you a dagger ? It 's best to put the point to his back , so he can say he drove under threat of annihilation if we 're stopped . " <p> " Why are you doing this ? " <p> " As a test . No one will believe your disguise . But everyone will believe you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proved it . " ( We careened about a dray loaded with sand . ) " Besides , we 'll win . I know this driver and his team 's fresh . The other 's been carting that whore for half the night . " <p> I realized then that I would be expected to give Agia the money if we won , and that the other woman would claim my ( nonexistent ) chrisos from Racho if they did . Yet how sweet to humble him ! Speed and the nearness of death ( for I felt certain I would indeed be slain by the hipparch ) made me more reckless than I had ever been in my life . I drew Terminus Est , and thanks to the length of her blade I could reach the onegars easily . Their flanks were already soaked with sweat , and the shallow cuts I made there must have burned like flames . " That 's better than any dagger , " I told Agia . <p> The crowd parted like water before the drivers ' whips , mothers clasping their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the safety of windowsills . The conditions of the race favored us : the fiacre ahead to some extent cleared our path , and it was more impeded by other vehicles than we . Still we gained only slowly , and to get a few ells ' advantage , our driver , who no doubt anticipated a rich tip if he won , sent the onegars hurtling up a flight of broad chalcedony steps . Marbles and monuments , pillars and pilasters , seemed thrown at our faces . We crashed through the green wall of a hedge as high as a house , overturned a cartload of comfits , dove through an arch and down a stair wound in a half turn , and were in the street again without ever knowing whose patio we had violated . <p> A baker 's barrow drawn by sheep ambled into the narrow space between our vehicle and the other , and our big rear wheel jolted it , sending a shower of fresh bread into the street and throwing Agia 's slight body against mine so pleasantly that I put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had clasped women so before - Thecla often , and hired bodies in the town . There was new bittersweetness in this , born of the cruel attraction Agia held for me . " I 'm glad you did that , " she said in my ear . " I hate men who grab me , " and covered my face with kisses . <p> The driver looked back with a grin of triumph , letting the maddened team choose its own path . " Gone down the Twisted Way - got them now - across the common and reach them by a hundred ells . " <p> The fiacre reeled and plunged into a narrow gateway in a barrier of shrubbery . An immense building loomed before us . The driver tried to turn his animals , but it was too late . We hit its side ; it gave like the fabric of a dream , and we were in a cavernous space , dimly lit and smelling of hay . Ahead was a stepped altar as large as a cottage and dotted with blue lights . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - our driver had been swept out of his seat or had jumped clear . Agia shrieked . <p> We crashed into the altar . There was a confusion of flying objects impossible to describe , the sense of everything whirling and tumbling and never colliding , as in the chaos before creation . The ground seemed to leap at me ; it struck with an impact that set my ears humming . <p> I had been holding Terminus Est , I think , while I flew through the air , but she was no longer in my hand . When I tried to get up to look for her , I had no breath and no strength . Somewhere far off , a man shouted . I rolled on my side , then managed to get my lifeless legs beneath me . <p> We seemed to be near the center of the building , which was as big around as the Great Keep and yet completely empty : without interior walls , stairs , or furniture of any kind . Through the golden , dusty air I could see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mere points of light , hung a chain or more overhead . Far above them , a many-colored roof rippled and snapped in a wind I could not feel . <p> I stood on straw , and straw was spread everywhere in an endless yellow carpet , like the field of a titan after harvest . All about me were the battens of which the altar had been constructed : fragments of thin wood braved with gold leaf and set with turquoises and violet amethysts . With some vague idea of finding my sword , I began to walk , stumbling almost at once over the smashed body of the fiacre . One onegar lay not far from it ; I recall thinking it must have broken its neck . Someone called , " Torturer ! " and I looked around and saw Agia - standing erect , though shakily . I asked if she were all right . <p> " Alive , anyway , but we must leave this place at once . Is that animal dead ? " <p> I nodded . <p> " I could have ridden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you can . I do n't think my right leg will bear my weight . " She tottered as she spoke , and I had to spring to her and catch her to keep her from falling . " Now we have to go , " she said . " Look around . . . can you see a door ? Quickly ! " <p> I could not . " Why is it so urgent that we leave ? " <p> " Use your nose if you ca n't use your eyes to see this floor . " <p> I sniffed . The odor in the air was no longer straw , but straw burning ; at almost the same instant I saw the flames , bright in the gloom , but still so small that a few moments before they must have been mere sparks . I tried to run , but could manage nothing better than a limping walk . " Where are we ? " <p> " It 's the Cathedral of the Pelerines - some call it the Cathedral of the Claw . The Pelerines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They never - " Agia broke off because we were approaching a cluster of scarlet-clad people . Or perhaps they were approaching us , for they seemed to me to have appeared in the middle distance without warning . The men had shaven heads and held gleaming scimitars curved like the young moon and blazing with gilding ; a woman with the towering height of an exultant cradled a sheathed two-handed sword : my own Terminus Est . She wore a hood and a narrow cape that trailed long tassels . Agia began , " Our animals ran wild , Holy Domnicellae . . . " <p> " That is of no moment , " the woman who held my sword said . There was much beauty in her , but it was not the beauty of women who quench desire . " This belongs to the man carrying you . Tell him to set you on your feet and take it . You can walk . " <p> " A little . Do as she says , Torturer . " <p> " Do n't you know his name ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgotten . " <p> I said , " Severian , " and steadied her with one hand while I accepted Terminus Est with the other . <p> " Use it to end quarrels , " the woman in scarlet said . " Not to begin them . " <p> " The straw floor of this great tent is on fire , Chatelaine . Do you know it ? " <p> " It will be extinguished . The sisters and our servants are crushing the embers now . " She paused , her gaze flickering from Agia to me and back to Agia again . <p> " In the remains of our high altar , which your vehicle destroyed , we found only one thing that seemed yours , and likely to be of value to you - that sword . We have returned it . Will you now also return to us anything of value to us you may have found ? " <p> I remembered the amethysts . " I found nothing of value , Chatelaine . " Agia shook her head , and I continued , " There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I left them where they had fallen . " <p> The men shifted the hilts of their weapons in the hands and sought good footing , but the tall woman stood motionless , staring at me , then at Agia , then at me once more . " Come to me , Severian . " <p> I came forward , a matter of three or four paces . It was a great temptation to draw Terminus Est as a defense against the men 's blades , but I resisted it . Their mistress took my wrists in her hands and looked into my eyes . Her own were calm , and in the strange light seemed hard as beryls . " There is no guilt in him , " she said . <p> I did as she told me , and Agia limped to within a long pace of her . When she would not come nearer , the tall woman came to her and took her wrists as she had mine . After a moment , she glanced toward the other women who had waited behind the swordsmen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seized Agia 's gown and drew it over her head and away . One said , " Nothing , Mother . " <p> " I think this the day foretold . " <p> Her hands crossed over her breasts , Agia whispered to me , " These Pelerines are insane . Everyone knows it , and if I had had more time I would have told you so . " <p> The tall woman said , " Return her rags . The Claw has not vanished in living memory , but it does so at will and it would be neither possible nor permissible for us to stop it . " <p> One of the women murmured , " We may find it in the wreckage still , Mother . " <p> A second added , " Should they not be made to pay ? " <p> " Let us kill them , " a man said . The tall woman gave no indication that she had heard any of them . She was already leaving us , seeming to glide across the straw . The women followed her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gleaming blades and backed away . Agia was struggling into her gown . I asked her what she knew of the Claw , and who these Pelerines were . <p> " Get me out of here , Severian , and I 'll tell you . It is n't lucky to talk of them in their own place . Is that a tear in the wall over there ? " We walked in the direction she had indicated , stumbling sometimes in the soft straw . There was no opening , but I was able to lift the edge of the silken wall enough for us to slip under .

He had forced himself to hold back , deny the instinctive need that ripped through his senses . <p> Now , in a matter of hours , he was ready to bed her for a single touch . <p> He was screwed . It was that simple , and he knew it . Just as he knew that there was n't a damned thing he could do to stop it . <p> Rachel stared at her shaking hands before breathing in roughly , collecting the items she needed and moving back to the bedroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> She checked Amber 's diaper , changed it quickly and all the while reminded herself , more than once , of all the reasons why she was n't going to allow herself to touch the man . He was such a fascination to her that she could barely keep her mind , let alone her hands , off him . <p> And now there was the added complication that he thought she was his mate ? <p> Oh , she knew about the mating . Merinus had been kind enough to go into detail--explicit , amazing detail--before Rachel had taken the job . That was just after Rachel had been asked to sign a confidentiality agreement that did n't just affect her own life , but any heirs she may come to have , and a very subtle warning of the grief family members could suffer if she ever divulged the information . But even if her friend had n't given her those details , Rachel would have still suspected the truth of the rumors that circulated . <p> Mating heat . Forced desires . Breed sexual virus . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Merinus 's description was kinder . Natural selection , she had called it . God had chosen the perfect mates for the children He had allowed the Council to create bodies for . <p> Merinus was nothing if not a great believer in a higher power . <p> So where did that leave Rachel ? <p> As she placed Amber on her shoulder , cuddling the child close to her and rubbing her back soothingly , Rachel began to pace the floor . <p> Jonas fascinated her too much . That was her problem . That had nothing to do with hormones , pheromones , or anything chemical or biological . It was simply an attraction she had learned to accept . <p> It was now a complication she was going to have to deal with . <p> After burping Amber and laying her down for a nap , Rachel let herself linger long enough to smooth her fingers over her child 's red-gold locks , and to once again be amazed that such a perfect creation had come from her body . <p> It was n't often that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her life . She tried to live in a way that ensured she had as few regrets as possible . But as she stared down at Amber , she wondered if she had made a mistake in informing Amber 's father of her birth . <p> Devon had n't been perfect , but she had felt he deserved to know about his child , whether she thought he would be interested or not . Now it was something she might regret though . Devon was so firmly against the Breeds that it was hard telling what he would do once he learned where Rachel and Amber were located . And finding her would n't be hard . The explosion at her home had been all over the news , as well as reports that Rachel and her child had been flown to Sanctuary . It would n't be something he would do out of love for his child , but rather out of pure spite . <p> Unfortunately , that was Devon 's personality . <p> Breathing out wearily , she leaned forward , kissed her daughter 's cheek , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaving the bedroom and venturing to the front porch of the cabin . <p> The large , single-story structure sat on the hill overlooking the main estate house . The three-story mansion had once been home to one of the labs the Genetics Council had created . <p> Beneath the historic home , a sprawling cement-and-steel structure had been built . The labs , confinement cells and soldiers ' barracks had been completely hidden from the citizens of nearby Buffalo Gap . The mountain had provided a perfect training location , while the area had been a strategic location for the Breeds to come and go from their assigned missions . <p> Stepping to the railing of the wraparound porch , she crossed her arms over her br**sts and fought to hold back the chill working down her spine . <p> " She 's sleeping again ? " Jonas stepped out as Rachel turned to him in surprise . <p> " I thought you 'd left . " For the barest second , her heart raced , breathlessness assailed her chest and her thighs tried to clench in response to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ total male perfection . Savagely hewn , exceptionally built . And those eyes . Staring into his eyes was like staring into a maelstrom of hunger . <p> She had seen that hunger the first time they 'd met , and it had never abated . <p> " Not yet . " Pushing his hands into his slacks , he moved closer and leaned against one of the porch 's huge support columns . " I was on the sat phone arranging the packing and delivery of the office here . Everything should arrive in a few hours . " <p> " Ely called while you were gone . She 's hoping that if she adds her plea to Dr. Vanderale 's , you 'll come to the lab for testing in the morning . " <p> Rachel tilted her head as she stared back at him . " If I have none of your mating heat signs , Jonas , then why should I do that ? My time is rather valuable , as I 'm certain you know . There 's quite a bit that has to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're transferring said office here , there will be only additional work . I doubt I 'll have time to pamper Ely or Dr. Vanderale in this matter . But should I change my mind , I promise you 'll be the first to know . " <p> Her mocking little speech produced much more of a reaction than she anticipated . For months , she had been throwing out the cute little asides in a particularly cool voice , and for months , Jonas had pretended to ignore them . <p> He was n't ignoring it now . <p> Before Rachel could move to evade , his hands gripped her arms , turning her to face him as his head bent , bringing his lips much too close to hers . Too much temptation , much too close . That 's what it was .

She wanted to get through the meal , get home , and just go to bed . Going out with this guy had been a colossal mistake no matter how nice he seemed to be . Shed known it the second after shed said yes . Regret had surged through her , but it had been too late then . <p> All she could think about was Liam .

It had scared her then but not now . She knew he would n't hurt her . Not physically . He might be dominating and sometimes too pushy , but he cared for her . In another world she might allow herself to care for him too . But they had no chance and she was n't going to risk getting her heart broken and losing her only family due to involvement with Liam . Especially when anything that happened between them could n't last . He barely looked thirty , but she knew he was over a hundred years old . <p> " Get rid of him .

He half smiled and her traitorous libido roared to life . Why did the soft candlelight have to play off his features , making him even better looking ? " Charming , handsome " <p> His smart-ass response annoyed her even more , but it also allowed her to find her voice . " Arrogant and annoying , " she said in a loud whisper , barely containing the need to shout at him .

As his masculine , earthy scent rolled over her , she struggled to remind herself why things would never work between them . When he looked at her with those captivating eyes , it was hard to remember her own name . <p> The sound of a man clearing his throat jerked her back to reality .

Holding her breath , she waited for him to move . <p> After what felt like an eternity , he finally stood . Completely ignoring her date , he looked at her . Anyone else would have said a few polite words or excused himself , but not Liam . It was n't in his DNA . He would n't be civil or polite if he did n't  mean it . " This is n't over , Red . " <p> Mercifully , instead of sitting back down , Liam nodded at the guy hed arrived with .

" Mike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exactly . I 'm really sorry that happened . " <p> He shrugged but she could see the annoyance in his expression . Not that she blamed him . In his position shed be ticked off too . When their server came back to take their order , she knew she could n't sit through a meal with this guy . Seeing Liam had shaken her to her core and made it clear she was n't interested in dating anyone else . Until she could purge him from her system , she might not ever be ready . Just knowing he was out there and available made everyone else pale in comparison . After asking their server to give her a few more minutes , she looked at her date . She was ready to bail , but he beat her to the punch . <p> " You want to leave , do n't  you ? " he asked , his voice wry . <p> Embarrassment flooded her but not enough that she changed her mind .

Curse of being a cops sister , she supposed . <p> " Its no problem and you do n't  have to pay . " He placed a clammy hand over hers . His hands were soft , unlike Liams callused , roughened ones . She did n't  know what it was , but the feel of this guy touching her made her feel i 'll . He slightly tightened his hold and something akin to fear jumped inside her . Which made no sense . He seemed like a nice man . Hed held open her doors and pulled out her chair and been perfectly polite . But he was n't Liam .

Her family was wealthy , whereas Sebastian was titled and in financial straits . And Lillian herself had promised to be an entertaining bed partner , with her dark-haired beauty and her fiery temperament . He should have chosen far less spirited prey .

Despite the inglorious pedigree , Evangeline might have made a decent enough match if not for her crippling shyness , which resulted in a torturous stammer . <p> Sebastian had heard men say grimly that they would wear a hair shirt until their skin was bloody rather than attempt a conversation with her . Naturally Sebastian had done his utmost to avoid her whenever possible . That had not been difficult . The timid Miss Jenner was wont to hide in corners . They had never actually spoken directlya circumstance that had appeared to suit both of them quite well . <p> But there was no avoiding her now . For some reason Miss Jenner had seen fit to come uninvited to Sebastians home at a scandalously late hour . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unaccompaniedand spending more than a half minute alone with Sebastian was sufficient to ruin any girl . He was debauched , amoral , and perversely proud of it . He excelled at his chosen occupationthat of degenerate seducerand he had set a standard few rakes could aspire to . <p> Relaxing in his chair , Sebastian watched with deceptive idleness as Evangeline Jenner approached . The library room was dark except for a small fire in the hearth , its flickering light playing gently over the young womans face . She did n't  look to be more than twenty , her complexion fresh , her eyes filled with the kind of innocence that never failed to arouse his disdain . Sebastian had never valued or admired innocence . <p> Though the gentlemanly thing would have been for him to rise from his chair , there seemed little point in making polite gestures under the circumstances . Instead , he motioned to the other chair beside the hearth with a negligent wave of his hand . <p> " Have a seat if you like , " he said . " Though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm easily bored , and your reputation is hardly that of a scintillating conversationalist . " <p> Evangeline did n't  flinch at his rudeness . Sebastian couldnt help but wonder what kind of upbringing had inured her so thoroughly to insult , when any other girl would have flushed or burst into tears . Either she was a pea wit , or she had remarkable nerve . <p> Removing her cloak , Evangeline draped it over one arm of the velvet-upholstered chair , and sat without grace or artifice . Wallflower , Sebastian thought , recalling that she was friends not only with Lillian Bowman , but also with Lillians younger sister , Daisy , and with Annabelle Hunt . The group of four young women had sat at the side of numerous balls and soirees all last season , a band of perpetual wallflowers .

He had never really looked at her directly , had only received the impression of a frowsy red-haired girl with bad posture . But she was lovely . <p> As Sebastian stared at her , he became aware of a slight tension building in his muscles , tiny hairs rising on the back of his neck . He remained relaxed in his chair , though the tips of his fingers made slight depressions in the soft-napped velvet upholstery . He found it odd that he had never noticed her , when there was a great deal worth noticing . Her hair , the brightest shade of red he had ever seen , seemed to feed on the firelight , glowing with incandescent heat . The slender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lashes were a darker shade of auburn , while her skin was that of a true redhead , fair and a bit freckled on the nose and cheeks . Sebastian was amused by the festive scattering of little gold flecks , sprinkled as if by the whim of a friendly fairy . She had unfashionably full lips that were colored a natural rose , and large , round blue eyespretty but emotionless eyes , like those of a wax doll . <p> " I r-received word that my friend Miss Bowman is now Lady Westcliff , " Evangeline remarked in a careful manner .

" <p> I gave her a small , comforting smile while a knot twisted in my stomach . " Take me to Shaya and Rurik . " <p> The two of them were surprised by my arrival , but something told me they had n't doubted I would return either . I could tell by the compassion on Shaya 's face that what Leith had done to me was common knowledge . To my surprise , it was Rurik I took the most comfort from . He did n't question my appearance . He offered no sympathies . He simply jumped straight to business . <p> " We 've gathered as many soldiers as we could while you 've been gone , " he said . " Some are camped outside , and Dorian 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The majority of yours is in Highmore . We 'll need to determine the best way to distribute them .

How on earth was I standing here , listening to a fairy soldier explain how to lead a war ? <p> I held up a hand . " Wait ... before you go any further . Is there ... is there any way this can be avoided ? " Kiyo 's words came back to me , and I hated to say what I did next . " Is there any way to make peace ? " <p> Rurik 's eyes widened , and shock and anger filled his features . " Peace ? After what- " <p> Shaya silenced him with a gesture of her own . " Yes , actually .

" <p> Shaya cleared her throat uncomfortably , and Rurik looked angry . " Well , " she began , " not entirely . For Katrice not to go to war , she demands that we become her subject kingdom and has very specific details on the kinds of tribute and taxes she requires for that . She also ... she also says that you must marry her nephew in place of her son and tie this kingdom to her through that branch of the family . My impression is she sent a similar list of demands to Dorian-aside from the nephew part-which he refused rather , ah , indelicately . " <p> I stared , my mouth agape . That was not what I had in mind . How could Katrice demand those kinds of things after what Leith had done ? How dare she act as though I had done something wrong ? Yes , I could imagine her grief for her only son . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggesting was ludicrous . And if she thought I would ever , ever let another member of her family lay a hand on me ... <p> I turned back to Rurik as though the issue of peace with Katrice had never been mentioned . Later , I would ask Shaya to help me compose a formal response to Katrice 's letter , something along the lines of I am the Thorn Queen . Fuck off . <p> " What should I do next ? " I asked Rurik . <p> He smiled , a fierce delight in his eyes . " You should speak to the soldiers gathered here and make an official declaration of war . And then you should go to Highmore and speak to the ones there . They do n't even know you as their queen yet , let alone the person sending them to fight . And you should practice up on your magic , both for battle and to show your own people that that Rowan bitch ca n't touch you . " <p> I shivered at the feelings his words inspired in me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from my magic , but now it was calling to me again . And with this threat from Katrice-no , this insult from Katrice-there was nothing I wanted more than to summon all the forces of nature and rip her apart . <p> " Dorian is coming here-today , I think , " said Shaya , interrupting my murderous thoughts . " Follow his lead . He knows what to do . " <p> I was n't entirely sure what that meant . The only thing I felt certain of was that I was n't quite ready to go over the maps Rurik had laid out and examine all the troop placements he had in mind . I 'd always sucked at Risk and had a feeling this would be similar . Besides , I had n't returned to the Thorn Land to make war-not right at this second , at least . I 'd come because of the dream from last night , the dream where I 'd felt at peace . <p> Because at the moment , I felt no peace . A gentry queen wanted to lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do the same to her . I 'd just broken up with my boyfriend , someone I loved dearly , because I-possibly irrationally-held him responsible for not protecting me from an assailant . And as for that assailant ... well , his face still flashed in my mind , and no matter how much time passed , I could n't seem to rid myself of that dirty feeling within me or my repulsion at being touched . <p> I swore to Rurik that I 'd talk to him later , that I needed some time to myself first , and left them both for one of the castle 's enclosed gardens . It was the one I frequently meditated in , where Shaya was still attempting to grow grass and where Kiyo and I had made love . I sat down there cross-legged , taking in the sun on the orange rocks around me and relishing in the faint breeze that stirred the branches of the mesquite and smokethorn trees .

The heat eventually made me sleepy , and I lay down on the grass , my hands digging into the earth . <p> When I woke up , two things immediate became apparent . First , I felt ... better . I felt strong and refreshed , and all around me , the colors and scents seemed stronger and more vivid . I still was n't happy about the impending war , but that horrible feeling in me ... the bitterness Leith had left ... well , it had lessened . The air hummed around me , and for a disorienting second , I could n't tell where I ended and the land began . It was then that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been in no condition to heal the land . It had had to heal me . I was energized now , ready to do anything . Ready to lead a war . <p> The other thing I noticed after waking was that Jasmine was sitting right beside me , gray eyes staring into mine . I bolted upright . " What the hell are you doing here ? " I exclaimed . " You 're not supposed to be loose . " <p> Girard 's cuffs were still upon her , and she jerked her head back toward the castle . " I 'm not exactly loose . " <p> I followed her motion and saw a dozen guards , all keeping a respectful distance , but all watching Jasmine closely . When Volusian had disappeared , Rurik had undoubtedly increased her security detail . <p> " Jasmine , " I said , " I 'm not really in the mood for your banter , okay ?

She was still serious and actually looked older than her age . <p> " He had no right . I told you before : no one does that to a daughter of Storm King . Not even to you . " <p> I was speechless for a moment , still waiting for a punch line . " Jasmine ... you hate me . " <p> She nodded . " Yup . But that does n't change what happened .

Our father 's heir can not be born from rape . I told you before-only someone worthy . That bastard was n't , and his mother has to pay for it . Once she 's done ... well , then I 'll deal with you . Besides , someone 's got to take her kingdom when we kill her . Might as well be me . " <p> Whoa .

It would also be handy to not have her trying to kill me . <p> " Well , then , thanks , " I said at last . I decided not to mention just then that there was no way in hell I would ever let her rule the Rowan Land . Details , details . <p> Jasmine looked supremely pleased . " So I can go free then , right ? " <p> I scoffed . " Not a chance . " <p> " But I 'm helping you ! " <p> " Yeah , and in the same breath , you talked about how you want to usurp me . Look ...

He 'd apparently been seeking me , hoping I 'd go talk to the gathered soldiers and inspire them-particularly since word had come that Dorian was almost here . I nodded quickly , promising anything , so long as I could get a moment to compose myself and summon my earlier confidence . All of this was overwhelming me .

I 'll make you pay . He 's mine . Do you understand ? Mine . " <p> This was followed by a whole tirade of ranting and insults about how much she hated me and would see me destroyed . She kept her distance , though , so apparently my brief lapse into violence had done some good . After a while , I had no patience for it and simply went into my bedroom , leaving her out there .

With a sigh of relief , I started to drape the dress over a chair-and caught a glimpse out the small window . <p> There was an army out there . <p> I immediately backed away , trying to block out the sea of faces encamped outside . I dropped the dress , feeling dizzy . The reality of it all hit me , and I again felt helpless and out of my league . A sharp knock sounded on the door , momentarily breaking through my panic .

Small , slim , and dark-haired , she still had the agility and exuberance of a child when other women her age had already become sober young matrons .

She was a relentless woman , all sharp angles , always pushing to make a place for the Bowmans in society . It was Mercedes who had insisted that since they could not break into the Knickerbocker set in New York , they would bring the girls to England . " We shall simply go over their heads , " she had said with determination .

The sound of a drawer being opened . Suddenly he imagined his mother grabbing for one of the knives . <p> Before I kill you , monster . <p> The thought rocked him back on his heels .

He switched hands and put the phone to his ear . " Hello ? " <p> " Simon ? " It was Clary . She sounded breathless . " Where are you ? " <p> " Home , " he said , and paused .

There were no clocks in Isabelle 's black and hot-pink powder-puff bedroom , just piles of clothes , heaps of books , stacks of weapons , a vanity overflowing with sparkling makeup , used brushes , and open drawers spilling lacy slips , sheer tights , and feather boas . It had a certain **31;59;TOOLONG design aesthetic , but over the past two weeks Clary had spent enough time among the glittering mess to have begun to find it comforting . <p> Isabelle , standing over by the window with Church in her arms , stroked the cat 's head absently .

Five minutes . <p> That had been the last thing she had said to the boy she loved more than anything else in the world . Now she thought it might be the last thing she would ever get to say to him . <p> Clary remembered the moment perfectly . The roof garden . The crystalline October night , the stars burning icy white against a cloudless black sky . The paving stones smeared with black runes , spattered with ichor and blood . Jace 's mouth on hers , the only warm thing in a shivering world . Clasping the Morgenstern ring around her neck . The love that moves the sun and all the other stars .

She had joined the others in the lobby , hugging her mother , Luke , Simon , but some part of her , as it always was , had still been with Jace , floating above the city on that rooftop , the two of them alone in the cold and brilliant electric city . <p> Maryse and Kadir had been the ones to get into the elevator to join Jace on the roof and to see the remains of Lilith 's ritual . It was another ten minutes before Maryse returned , alone . When the doors had opened and Clary had seen her face-white and set and frantic-she had known . <p> What had happened next had been like a dream . The crowd of Shadowhunters in the lobby had surged toward Maryse ; Alec had broken away from Magnus , and Isabelle had leaped to her feet . White bursts of light cut through the darkness like the soft explosions of camera flashes at a crime scene as , one after another , seraph blades @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard the story in broken pieces-the rooftop garden was empty ; Jace was gone . The glass coffin that had held Sebastian had been smashed open ; glass was lying everywhere in fragments . Blood , still fresh , dripped down the pedestal on which the coffin had sat . <p> The Shadowhunters were making plans quickly , to spread out in a radius and search the area around the building . Magnus was there , his hands sparking blue , turning to Clary to ask if she had something of Jace 's they could track him with . Numbly , she gave him the Morgenstern ring and retreated into a corner to call Simon . She had only just closed the phone when the voice of a Shadowhunter rang out above the rest . " Tracking ? That 'll work only if he 's still alive . With that much blood it 's not very likely- " <p> Somehow that was the last straw . Prolonged hypothermia , exhaustion , and shock took their toll , and she felt her knees give . Her mother caught her before she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . She woke up the next morning in her bed at Luke 's , sitting bolt upright with her heart going like a trip-hammer , sure she had had a nightmare . <p> As she struggled out of bed , the fading bruises on her arms and legs told a different story , as did the absence of her ring . Throwing on jeans and a hoodie , she staggered out into the living room to find Jocelyn , Luke , and Simon seated there with somber expressions on their faces . She did n't even need to ask , but she did anyway : " Did they find him ? Is he back ? " <p> Jocelyn stood up . " Sweetheart , he 's still missing- " <p> " But not dead ? They have n't found a body ?

" <p> Her veins felt as if her blood had been replaced with ice water . " I want to help . I want to do something . I do n't want to just sit here while Jace is missing . " <p> " I would n't worry about that , " Jocelyn said grimly . " The Clave wants to see you . " <p> " You 'll tell them anything they want because they have the Mortal Sword .

" <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after scores of witnesses had been called , after she had held the Mortal Sword a dozen times , Clary sat in Isabelle 's bedroom and waited for the Council to rule on her fate . She could n't help but remember what it had felt like to hold the Mortal Sword . It was like tiny fishhooks embedded in your skin , pulling the truth out of you . She had knelt , holding it , in the circle of the Speaking Stars and had heard her own voice telling the Council everything : how Valentine had raised the Angel Raziel , and how she had taken the power of controlling the Angel from him by erasing his name in the sand and writing hers over it . She had told them how the Angel had offered her one wish , and she had used it to raise Jace from the dead ; she told them how Lilith had possessed Jace and Lilith had planned to use Simon 's blood to resurrect Sebastian , Clary 's brother , whom Lilith regarded as a son . How Simon 's Mark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sebastian had been ended too , no longer a threat . <p> Clary sighed and flipped her phone open to check the time . " They 've been in there for an hour , " she said . " Is that normal ? Is it a bad sign ? " <p> Isabelle dropped Church , who let out a yowl . She came over to the bed and sat down beside Clary . Isabelle looked even more slender than usual-like Clary , she 'd lost weight in the past two weeks-but elegant as always , in black cigarette pants and a fitted gray velvet top . Mascara was smudged all around Izzy 's eyes , which should have made her look like a racoon but just made her look like a French film star instead . She stretched her arms out , and her electrum bracelets with their rune charms jingled musically . " No , it 's not a bad sign , " she said . " It just means they have a lot to talk over . " She twisted the Lightwood ring on her finger . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Law . That 's the important thing . " <p> Clary sighed . Even the warmth of Isabelle 's shoulder next to hers could n't melt the ice in her veins . She knew that technically she had broken no Laws , but she also knew the Clave was furious at her . It was illegal for a Shadowhunter to raise the dead , but not for the Angel to do it ; nevertheless it was such an enormous thing she had done in asking for Jace 's life back that she and Jace had agreed to tell no one about it . <p> Now it was out , and it had rocked the Clave . Clary knew they wanted to punish her , if only because her choice had had such disastrous consequences . In some way she wished they would punish her . Break her bones , pull her fingernails out , let the Silent Brothers root through her brain with their bladed thoughts . A sort of devil 's bargain-her own pain for Jace 's safe return . It would have helped her guilt over having left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the others had told her a hundred times she was being ridiculous-that they had all thought he was perfectly safe there , and that if Clary had stayed , she would probably now be missing too . <p> " Quit it , " Isabelle said . For a moment Clary was n't sure if Isabelle was talking to her or to the cat . Church was doing what he often did when dropped-lying on his back with all four legs in the air , pretending to be dead in order to induce guilt in his owners . But then Isabelle swept her black hair aside , glaring , and Clary realized she was the one being told off , not the cat .

He remembered that night a few days after the gray plague started when he found a wretched woman being chased through the streets of a burning city by a pack of abusive men . Saint John had seen such horrors a thousand times as the world crumbled and died , but this one instance drew his attention .

It was hard to say , because there is a level of pain so pure that it strips away gender and identity , and that was what he heard now . <p> Saint John nodded his appreciation .

Only six hundred of them escaped the burning of their town . Of those , four hundred reached the mountains of southern Nevada . Barely two hundred made it to this patch of wild forestland in the arid Mojave . <p> Saint John doubted that a hundred heretics still remained on this side of the darkness . <p> Soon red doors would open for each of them .

The book was released on 21 July 2007 by Bloomsbury Publishing in the United Kingdom , in the United States by Scholastic , and in Canada by Raincoast Books , ending the series that began in 1997 with the publication of Harry Potter and the Philosopher 's Stone . The novel chronicles the events directly following Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince ( 2005 ) , and the final confrontation between the wizards Harry Potter and Lord Voldemort . Rowling finished writing Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows in January 2007 . Before its release , Bloomsbury reportedly spent GB-10 million to keep the book 's contents safe before its release date .

" <p> " Rogues and cutthroats , scum of a hundred battlefields , " Ser Barristan warned , " with captains full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only a young girl and know little of such things , but it seems to me that we want them to be treacherous . Once , you 'll recall , I convinced the Second Sons and Stormcrows to join us .

Their absence would be noted even if you could separate them discreetly from the Yunkai ' <p> i . We must find some quieter way of reaching out to them not tonight , but soon . " <p> " As you command . Though I fear this is not a task for which I am well suited . In King 's Landing work of this sort was left to Lord Littlefinger or the Spider . We old knights are simple men , only good for fighting . " He patted his sword hilt . <p> " Our prisoners , " suggested Dany . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dornishmen . We still have them in cells , do we not ? Use them . " <p> " Free them , you mean ? Is that wise ? They were sent here to worm their way into your trust , so they might betray Your Grace at the first chance . " <p> " Then they failed . I do not trust them . I will never trust them . " If truth be told , Dany was forgetting how to trust . " We can still use them . One was a woman . Meris . Send her back , as a a gesture of my regard . If their captain is a clever man , he will understand . " <p> " The woman is the worst of all . " <p> " All the better . " Dany considered a moment . " We should sound out the Long Lances too . And the Company of the Cat . " <p> " Bloodbeard . " Ser Barristan 's frown deepened . " If it please Your Grace , we want no part of him . Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but this Bloodbeard is cut from the same savage cloth . There is no honor in him , only hunger for gold , for glory , for blood . " <p> " You know more of such men than me , ser . " If Bloodbeard might be truly the most dishonorable and greedy of the sellswords , he might be the easiest to sway , but she was loath to go against Ser Barristan 's counsel in such matters . " Do as you think best . But do it soon . If Hizdahr 's peace should break , I want to be ready . I do not trust the slavers . " <p> I do not trust my <p> husband . " They will turn on us at the first sign of weakness . " <p> " The Yunkai'i grow weaker as well . The bloody flux has taken hold amongst the Tolosi , it is said , and spread across the river to the third Ghiscari legion . " <p> The pale mare . Daenerys sighed . Quaithe warned me of the pale mare ' s coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the sun ' s son . She told me much and more , but all in riddles . " I can not rely on plague to save me from my enemies . Set Pretty Meris free . At once . " <p> " As you command . Though Your Grace , if I may be so bold , there is another road " <p> " The Dornish road ? " Dany sighed . The three Dornishmen had been at the feast , as befit Prince Quentyn 's rank , though Reznak had taken care to seat them as far as possible from her husband . Hizdahr did not seem to be of a jealous nature , but no man would be pleased by the presence of a rival suitor near his new bride . " The boy seems pleasant and well spoken , but " <p> " House Martell is ancient and noble , and has been a leal friend to House Targaryen for more than a century , Your Grace . I had the honor of serving with Prince Quentyn 's great-uncle in your father 's seven . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could wish for . Quentyn Martell is of the same blood , if it please Your Grace . " <p> " It would please me if he had turned up with these fifty thousand swords he speaks of . Instead he brings two knights and a parchment . Will a parchment shield my people from the Yunkai'i ? If he had come with a fleet " <p> " Sunspear has never been a sea power , Your Grace . " <p> " No . " Dany knew enough of Westerosi history to know that . Nymeria had landed ten thousand ships upon Dorne 's sandy shores , but when she wed her Dornish prince she had burned them all and turned her back upon the sea forever . " Dorne is too far away . To please this prince , I would need to abandon all my people . You should send him home . " <p> " Dornishmen are notoriously stubborn , Your Grace . Prince <p> Quentyn 's forebears fought your own for the better part of two hundred years . He will not go without you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unless there is more to him than I can see . " Is he still within ? " <p> " Drinking with his knights . " <p> " Bring him to me . It is time he met my children . " <p> A flicker of doubt passed across the long , solemn face of Barristan Selmy . " As you command . " <p> Her king was laughing with Yurkhaz zo Yunzak and the other Yunkish lords . Dany did not think that he would miss her , but just in case she instructed her handmaids to tell him that she was answering a call of nature , should he inquire after her . <p> Ser Barristan was waiting by the steps with the Dornish prince . Martell 's square face was flushed and ruddy . Too much wine , the queen concluded , though he was doing his best to conceal that . Apart from the line of copper suns that ornamented his belt , the Dornishman was plainly dressed . They call him Frog , Dany recalled . She could see why . He was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prince . It is a long way down . Are you certain that you wish to do this ? " <p> " If it would please Your Grace . " <p> " Then come . " <p> A pair of Unsullied went down the steps before them , bearing torches ; behind came two Brazen Beasts , one masked as a fish , the other as a hawk . Even here in her own pyramid , on this happy night of peace and celebration , Ser Barristan insisted on keeping guards about her everywhere she went . The small company made the long descent in silence , stopping thrice to refresh themselves along the way . " The dragon has three heads , " <p> Dany said <p> when they were on the final flight . " My marriage need not be the end of all your hopes . I know why you are here . " <p> " For you , " said Quentyn , all awkward gallantry . " No , " said Dany . <p> " For fire and blood . " <p> One of the elephants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from below made her flush with sudden heat . Prince Quentyn looked up in alarm . " The dragons know when she is near , " Ser Barristan told him . Every child knows its mother , Dany thought . When the seas go dry and mountains blow in the wind like leaves " They call to me . Come . " <p> She took Prince Quentyn by the hand and led him to the pit where two of her dragons were confined . " Remain outside , " Dany told Ser Barristan , as the Unsullied were opening the huge iron doors . " Prince Quentyn will protect me . " She drew the Dornish prince inside with her , to stand above the pit . The dragons craned their necks around , gazing at them with burning eyes . Viserion had shattered one chain and melted the others . He clung to the roof of the pit like some huge white bat , his claws dug deep into the burnt and crumbling bricks . Rhaegal , still chained , was gnawing on the carcass of a bull . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the last time she had been down here , and the walls and floors were black and grey , more ash than brick . They would not hold much longer but behind them was only earth and stone . Can dragons tunnel through rock , like the firewyrms of old Valyria ? She hoped not . <p> The Dornish prince had gone as white as milk . " I I had heard that there were three . " <p> " Drogon is hunting . " He did not need to hear the rest . " The white one is Viserion , the green is Rhaegal . I named them for my brothers . " Her voice echoed off the scorched stone walls . It sounded smalla girl 's voice , not the voice of a queen and conqueror , nor the glad voice of a new-made bride . <p> Rhaegal roared in answer , and fire filled the pit , a spear of red and yellow . Viserion replied , his own flames gold and orange . When he flapped his wings , a cloud of grey ash filled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legs . Quentyn Martell jumped back a foot . A crueler woman might have laughed at him , but Dany squeezed his hand and said , " They frighten me as well . There is no shame in that . My children have grown wild and angry in the dark . " <p> " You you mean to ride them ? " <p> " One of them . All I know of dragons is what my brother told me when I was a girl , and some I read in books , but it is said that even Aegon the Conqueror never dared mount Vhagar or Meraxes , nor did his sisters ride Balerion the Black Dread . Dragons live longer than men , some for hundreds of years , so Balerion had other riders after Aegon died but no rider ever flew two dragons . " <p> Viserion hissed again . Smoke rose between his teeth , and deep down in his throat they could see gold fire churning . <p> " They are they are fearsome creatures . " <p> " They are dragons , Quentyn . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once on each cheek . " And so am I. " <p> The young prince swallowed . " I I have the blood of the dragon in me as well , Your Grace . I can trace my lineage back to the first Daenerys , the Targaryen princess who was sister to King Daeron the Good and wife to the Prince of Dorne . He built the Water Gardens for her . " <p> " The Water Gardens ? " She knew little and less of Dorne or its history , if truth be told . <p> " My father 's favorite palace . It would please me to show them to you one day . They are all of pink marble , with pools and fountains , overlooking the sea . " <p> " They sound lovely . " She drew him away from the pit . He does not belong here . He should never have come . " You ought to return there . My court is no safe place for you , I fear . You have more enemies than you know . You made Daario @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to forget such a slight . " <p> " I have my knights . My sworn shields . " <p> " Two knights . Daario has five hundred Stormcrows . And you would do well to beware of my lord husband too . He seems a mild and pleasant man , I know , but do not be deceived . Hizdahr 's crown derives from mine , and he commands the allegiance of some of the most fearsome fighters in the world . If one of them should think to win his favor by disposing of a rival " <p> " I am a prince of Dorne , Your Grace . I will not run from slaves and sell swords . " <p> Then you truly are a fool , Prince Frog . Dany gave her wild children one last lingering look . She could hear the dragons screaming as she led the boy back to the door , and see the play of light against the bricks , reflections of their fires . If I look back , I am lost . " Ser Barristan will have summoned a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the banquet , but the climb can still be wearisome . " Behind them , the great iron doors closed with a resounding clang . " Tell me of this other Daenerys . I know less than I should of the history of my father 's kingdom . I never had a maester growing up . " Only a brother . <p> " It would be my pleasure , Your Grace , " said Quentyn . <p> It was well past midnight before the last of their guests took their leave and Dany retired to her own apartments to join her lord and king . Hizdahr at least was happy , if somewhat drunk . " I keep my promises , " he told her , as Irri and Jhiqui were robing them for bed . " You wished for peace , and it is yours . " <p> And you wished for blood , and soon enough I must give it to you , Dany thought , but what she said was , " I am grateful . " <p> The excitement of the day had inflamed her husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the night than he tore the robe from her and tumbled her backwards into bed . Dany slid her arms around him and let him have his way . Drunk as he was , she knew he would not be inside her long . <p> Nor was he . Afterward he nuzzled at her ear and whispered , " Gods grant that we have made a son tonight . " <p> The words of Mirri Maz Duur rang in her head . When the sun rises in the west and sets in the east . When the seas go dry and mountains blow in the wind like leaves . When your womb quickens again , and you bear a living child . Then he will return , and not before . The meaning was plain enough ; Khal Drogo was as like to return from the dead as she was to bear a living child . But there are some secrets she could not bring herself to share , even with a husband , so she let Hizdahr zo Loraq keep his hopes . Her noble husband was soon fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She wanted to shake him , wake him , make him hold her , kiss her , fuck her again , but even if he did , he would fall back to sleep again afterward , leaving her alone in the darkness . She wondered what Daario was doing . Was he restless as well ? Was he thinking about her ? Did he love her , truly ? Did he hate her for marrying Hizdahr ? I should never have taken him into my bed . He was only a sellsword , no fit consort for a queen , and yet <p> I knew that all along , but I did it anyway . " My queen ? " said a soft voice in the darkness . <p> Dany flinched . " Who is there ? " <p> " Only Missandei . " The Naathi scribe moved closer to the bed . <p> " This one heard you crying . " <p> " Crying ? I was not crying . Why would I cry ? I have my peace , I have my king , I have everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dream , that was all . " <p> " As you say , Your Grace . " She bowed and made to go . " Stay , " <p> said Dany . " I do not wish to be alone . " <p> " His Grace is with you , " Missandei pointed out . " His Grace is dreaming , but I can not sleep . On the morrow I must bathe in blood . The price of peace . " She smiled wanly and patted the bed . " Come . Sit . Talk with me . " <p> " Home , " said Dany . " Naath . Butterflies and brothers . Tell me of the things that make you happy , the things that make you giggle , all your sweetest memories . Remind me that there is still good in the world . " <p> Missandei did her best . She was still talking when Dany finally fell to sleep , to dream queer , half-formed dreams of smoke and fire . The morning came too soon . 
@@37757001 @6757001/ <p> It was not all his fear of drowning , though that was surely some of it . It was the motion of the ship as well , the way the decks rolled beneath his feet . " I have a queasy belly , " he confessed to Dareon the day they sailed from Eastwatch-by-the-Sea . The singer slapped him on the back and said , " With a belly big as yours , Slayer , that is a lot of quease . " <p> Sam tried to keep a brave face on him , for Gilly 's sake if little else . She had never seen the sea before . When they were struggling through the snows after fleeing Craster 's Keep , they had come on several lakes , and even those had been a wonder to her . As Blackbird slipped away from shore the girl began to tremble , and big salt tears rolled down her cheeks . " Gods be good , " Sam heard her whisper . Eastwatch vanished first , and the Wall grew smaller and smaller in the distance , until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then . The sails were the faded grey of a black cloak that had been washed too often , and Gilly 's face was white with fear . " This is a good ship , " Sam tried to tell her . " You do n't have to be afraid . " But she only looked at him , held her baby tighter , and fled below . <p> Sam soon found himself clutching tightly to the gunwale and watching the sweep of the oars . The way they all moved together was somehow beautiful to behold , and better than looking at the water . Looking at the water only made him think of drowning . When he was small his lord father had tried to teach him how to swim by throwing him into the pond beneath Horn Hill . The water had gotten in his nose and in his mouth and in his lungs , and he coughed and wheezed for hours after Ser Hyle pulled him out . After that he never dared go in any deeper than his waist . <p> The Bay of Seals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so friendly as that little fishpond below his father 's castle . Its waters were grey and green and choppy , and the wooded shore they followed was a snarl of rocks and whirlpools . Even if he could kick and crawl that far somehow , the waves were like to smash him up against some stone and break his head to pieces . <p> " Looking for mermaids , Slayer ? " asked Dareon when he saw Sam staring off across the bay . Fair-haired and hazel-eyed , the handsome young singer out of Eastwatch looked more like some dark prince than a black brother . <p> " No . " Sam did not know what he was looking for , or what he was doing on this boat . Going to the Citadel to forge a chain and be a maester , to be of better service to the Watch , he told himself , but the thought just made him weary . He did not want to be a maester , with a heavy chain wrapped around his neck , cold against his skin . He did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'd ever had . And he certainly did not want to face the father who had sent him to the Wall to die . <p> It was different for the others . For them , the voyage would have a happy ending . Gilly would be safe at Horn Hill , with all the width of West-eros between her and the horrors she had known in the haunted forest . As a serving maid in his father 's castle , she would be warm and well fed , a small part of a great world she could never have dreamed of as Craster 's wife . She would watch her son grow up big and strong , and become a huntsman or a stablehand or a smith . If the boy showed any aptitude for arms , some knight might even take him as a squire . <p> Maester Aemon was going to a better place as well . It was pleasant to think of him spending whatever time remained him bathed by the warm breezes of Oldtown , conversing with his fellow maesters and sharing his wisdom with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hundred times over . <p> Even Dareon would be happier . He had always claimed to be innocent of the rape that sent him to the Wall , insisting that he belonged at some lord 's court , singing for his supper . Now he would have that chance . Jon had named him a recruiter , to take the place of a man named Yoren , who had vanished and was presumed dead . His task would be to travel the Seven Kingdoms , singing of the valor of the Night 's Watch , and from time to time returning to the Wall with new recruits . <p> The voyage would be long and rough , no one could deny that , but for the others at least there would be a happy end . That was Sam 's solace . I am going for them , he told himself , for the Night 's Watch , and for the happy ending . The longer he looked at the sea , though , the colder and deeper it appeared . <p> But not looking at the water was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sterncastle that the passengers were sharing . He tried to take his mind off the roiling in his stomach by talking with Gilly as she nursed her son . " This ship will take us as far as Braavos , " he said . " We 'll find another ship to carry us to Oldtown . I read a book about Braavos when I was small . The whole city is built in a lagoon on a hundred little islands , and they have a titan there , a stone man hundreds of feet high . They have boats instead of horses , and their mummers play out written stories instead of just making up the usual stupid farces . The food is very good too , especially the fish . They have all kinds of clams and eels and oysters , fresh from their lagoon . We ought to have a few days between ships . If we do , we can go and see a mummer show , and have some oysters . " <p> He thought that would excite her . He could not have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dull eyes , looking through some strands of unwashed hair . " If you want , m'lord . " <p> " What do you want ? " Sam asked her . <p> " Nothing . " She turned away from him and moved her son from one breast to the other . <p> The motion of the boat was stirring up the eggs and bacon and fried bread that Sam had eaten before the ship set out . All at once he could not stand the cabin one more instant . He pushed himself back to his feet and clambered up the ladder to give his breakfast to the sea . The sickness came on Sam so strongly that he did not stop to gauge which way the wind was blowing , so he retched from the wrong rail and ended up spattering himself . Even so , he felt much better afterward . . . though not for long . <p> The ship was Blackbird , the largest of the Watch 's galleys . Storm Crow and Talon were faster , Cotter Pyke told Maester Aemon back at Eastwatch-by-the-Sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birds of prey where the rowers sat on open decks . Blackbird was a better choice for the rough waters of the narrow sea beyond Skagos . " There have been storms , " Pyke warned them . " Winter storms are worse , but autumn 's are more frequent . " <p> The first ten days were calm enough , as Blackbird crept across the Bay of Seals , never out of sight of land . It was cold when the wind was blowing , but there was something bracing about the salt smell in the air . Sam could hardly eat , and when he did force something down it did not stay down for long , but aside from that he did not do too badly . He tried to bolster Gilly 's courage and give her what cheer he could , but that proved hard . She would not come up on deck , no matter what he said , and seemed to prefer to huddle in the dark with her son . The babe liked the ship no more than his mother did , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retching up his mother 's milk . His bowels were loose and always moving , staining the furs that Gilly wrapped him in to keep him warm and filling the air with a brown stench . No matter how many tallow candles Sam lit , the smell of shit persisted . <p> It was more pleasant out in the open air , especially when Dareon was singing . The singer was known to Blackbird 's oarsmen , and would play for them as they rowed . He knew all their favorite songs : sad ones like " The Day They Hanged Black Robin , " " The Mermaid 's Lament , " and " Autumn of My Day , " rousing ones like " Iron Lances " and " Seven Swords for Seven Sons , " bawdy ones like " Milady 's Supper , " " Her Little Flower , " and " Meggett Was a Merry Maid , a Merry Maid Was She . " When he sang " The Bear and the Maiden Fair , " all the oarsmen joined in , and Blackbird seemed to fly across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swordsman , Sam knew from their days training under Alliser Thorne , but he had a beautiful voice . " Honey poured over thunder , " Maester Aemon had once called it . He played woodharp and fiddle too , and even wrote his own songs . . . though Sam did not think them very good . Still , it was good to sit and listen , though the chest was so hard and splintery that Sam was almost grateful for his fleshy buttocks . Fat men take a cushion with them wherever they go , he thought . <p> Maester Aemon preferred to spend his days on deck as well , huddled beneath a pile of furs and gazing out across the water . " What is he looking at ? " Dareon wondered one day . " For him it 's as dark up here as it is down in the cabin . " <p> The old man heard him . Though Aemon 's eyes had dimmed and gone dark , there was nothing wrong with his ears . " I was not born blind , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , I saw every rock and tree and whitecap , and watched the grey gulls flying in our wake . I was five-and-thirty and had been a maester of the chain for sixteen years . Egg wanted me to help him rule , but I knew my place was here . He sent me north aboard the Golden Dragon , and insisted that his friend Ser Duncan see me safe to Eastwatch . No recruit had arrived at the Wall with so much pomp since Nymeria sent the Watch six kings in golden fetters . Egg emptied out the dungeons too , so I would not need to say my vows alone . My honor guard , he called them . One was no less a man than Brynden Rivers . Later he was chosen lord commander . " <p> " Bloodraven ? " said Dareon . " I know a song about him . A Thousand Eyes , and One , ' it 's called . But I thought he lived a hundred years ago . " <p> " We all did . Once I was as young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He coughed , and closed his eyes , and went to sleep , swaying in his furs whenever some wave rocked the ship . <p> Beneath grey skies they sailed , east and south and east again , as the Bay of Seals widened about them . The captain , a grizzled brother with a belly like a keg of ale , wore blacks so stained and faded that the crew called him Old Tattersalt . He seldom said a word . His mate made up for him , blistering the salt air with curses whenever the wind died or the oarsmen seemed to flag . They ate oaten porridge in the mornings , pease porridge in the afternoons , and salt beef , salt cod , and salt mutton at night , and washed it down with ale . Dareon sang , Sam retched , Gilly cried and nursed her babe , Maester Aemon slept and shivered , and the winds grew colder and more blustery with every passing day . <p> Even so , it was a better voyage than the last one Sam had taken . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sail on Lord Redwyne 's galleas , the Arbor Queen . Five times as large as Blackbird and magnificent to behold , she had three great burgundy sails and banks of oars that flashed gold and white in the sunlight . The way they rose and fell as the ship departed Oldtown had made Sam hold his breath . . . but that was the last good memory he had of the Redwyne Straits . Then as now the sea had made him sick , to his lord father 's disgust . <p> And when they reached the Arbor , things had gone from bad to worse . Lord Redwyne 's twin sons had despised Sam on first sight . Every morn they found some fresh way to shame him in the practice yard . On the third day Horas Redwyne made him squeal like a pig when he begged for quarter . On the fifth his brother Hobber clad a kitchen girl in his own armor and let her beat Sam with a wooden sword until he began to cry . When she revealed herself , all the squires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The boy needs a bit of seasoning , that 's all , " his father had told Lord Redwyne that night , but Redwyne 's fool rattled his rattle and replied , " Aye , a pinch of pepper , a few nice cloves , and an apple in his mouth . " Thereafter , Lord Randyll forbade Sam to eat apples so long as they remained beneath Paxter Redwyne 's roof . He had been seasick on their voyage home as well , but so relieved to be going that he almost welcomed the taste of vomit at the back of his throat . It was not until they were back at Horn Hill that his mother told Sam that his father had never meant for him to return . " Horas was to come with us in your place , whilst you remained on the Arbor as Lord Paxter 's page and cupbearer . If you had pleased him , you would have been betrothed to his daughter . " Sam could still recall the soft touch of his mother 's hand as she washed the tears off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her spit . " My poor Sam , " she murmured . " My poor poor Sam . " <p> It will be good to see her again , he thought , as he clung to Blackbird 's rail and watched waves breaking on the stony shore . If she saw me in my blacks , it might even make her proud . " I am a man now , Mother , " I could tell her , " a steward , and a man of the Night 's Watch . My brothers call me Sam the Slayer sometimes . " He would see his brother Dickon too , and his sisters . " See , " I could tell them , " see , I was good for something after all . " <p> If he went to Horn Hill , though , his father might be there . <p> The thought made his belly heave again . Sam bent over the gunwale and retched , but not into the wind . He had gone to the right rail this time . He was getting good at retching . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land behind and struck east across the bay for the shores of Skagos . <p> The island sat at the mouth of the Bay of Seals , massive and mountainous , a stark and forbidding land peopled by savages . They lived in caves and grim mountain fastnesses , Sam had read , and rode great shaggy unicorns to war . Skagos meant " stone " in the Old Tongue . The Skagosi named themselves the stoneborn , but their fellow northmen called them Skaggs and liked them little . Only a hundred years ago Skagos had risen in rebellion . Their revolt had taken years to quell and claimed the life of the Lord of Winterfell and hundreds of his sworn swords . Some songs said the Skaggs were cannibals ; supposedly their warriors ate the hearts and livers of the men they slew . In ancient days , the Skagosi had sailed to the nearby isle of Skane , seized its women , slaughtered its men , and ate them on a pebbled beach in a feast that lasted for a fortnight . Skane remained unpeopled to this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When the bleak grey peaks of Skagos rose up from the sea , he joined Sam at Blackbird 's prow , and said , " If the gods are good , we may catch a glimpse of a unicorn . " <p> " If the captain is good , we wo n't come that close . The currents are treacherous around Skagos , and there are rocks that can crack a ship 's hull like an egg . But do n't you mention that to Gilly . She 's scared enough . " <p> " Her and that squalling whelp of hers . I do n't know which of them is noisier . The only time he ever stops crying is when she shoves a nipple in his mouth , and then she starts to sob . " <p> Sam had noticed that as well . " Maybe the babe is hurting her , " he said , feebly . " If his teeth are coming in . . . " <p> Dareon plucked at his lute with one finger , sending up a derisive note . " I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She is brave , " Sam insisted , though even he had to admit that he had never seen Gilly in such a wretched state . Though she hid her face more oft than not and kept the cabin dark , he could see that her eyes were always red , her cheeks wet with tears . When he asked her what was wrong , though , she only shook her head , leaving him to find answers of his own . " The sea scares her , that 's all , " he told Dareon . " Before she came to the Wall , all she knew was Craster 's Keep and the woods around it . I do n't know that she went more than half a league from the place that she was born . She knows streams and rivers , but she had never seen a lake until we came on one , and the sea . . . the sea is a scary thing . " <p> " We 've never been out of sight of land . " <p> " We will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Surely a little water does not frighten the Slayer . " <p> " No , " Sam lied , " not me . But Gilly . . . maybe if you played some lullabies for them , it would help the babe to sleep . " <p> Dareon 's mouth twisted in disgust . " Only if she shoves a plug up his arse . I can not abide the smell . " <p> The next day the rains began , and the seas grew rougher . " We had best go below , where it 's dry , " Sam said to Aemon , but the old maester only smiled , and said , " The rain feels good against my face , Sam . It feels like tears . Let me stay a while longer , I pray you . It has been a long time since last I wept . " <p> If Maester Aemon meant to stay on deck , old and frail as he was , Sam had no choice but to do the same . He stayed beside the old man for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a soft , steady rain soaked him to his skin . Aemon hardly seemed to feel it . He sighed and closed his eyes , and Sam moved closer to him , to shield him from the worst of the wind . He will ask me to help him to the cabin soon , he told himself . He must . But he never did , and finally thunder began to rumble in the distance , off to the east . " We have to get below , " Sam said , shivering . Maester Aemon did not reply . It was only then that Sam realized the old man had gone to sleep . " Maester , " he said , shaking him gently by one shoulder . " Maester Aemon , wake up . " <p> Aemon 's blind white eyes came open . " Egg ? " he said , as the rain streamed down his cheeks . " Egg , I dreamed that I was old . " <p> Sam did not know what to do . He knelt and scooped the old man up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong , and the rain had soaked through Maester Aemon 's blacks and made him twice as heavy , but even so , he weighed no more than a child . <p> When he shoved into the cabin with Aemon in his arms , he found that Gilly had let all the candles gutter out . The babe was asleep and she was curled up in a corner , sobbing softly in the folds of the big black cloak that Sam had given her . " Help me , " he said urgently . " Help me dry him off and get him warm . " <p> She rose at once , and together they got the old maester out of his wet clothes and buried him beneath a pile of furs . His skin was damp and cold , though , clammy to the touch . " You get in with him , " Sam told Gilly . " Hold him . Warm him with your body . We have to warm him up . " She did that too , never saying a word , all the while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sam . " We 'd all be warmer if we were together . He needs to be here too . " He was headed back up top to find the singer when the deck rose up beneath him , then fell away beneath his feet . Gilly wailed , Sam slammed down hard and lost his legs , and the babe woke screaming . <p> The next roll of the ship came as he was struggling back to his feet . It threw Gilly into his arms , and the wildling girl clung to him so fiercely that Sam could hardly breathe . " Do n't you be frightened , " he told her . " This is just an adventure . One day you 'll tell your son this tale . " That only made her dig her nails into his arm . She shuddered , her whole body shaking with the violence of her sobs . Whatever I say just makes her worse . He held her tightly , uncomfortably aware of her breasts pressing up against him . As frightened as he was , somehow that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he thought , ashamed , but if she did , she gave no sign , only clung to him the harder . <p> The days ran together after that . They never saw the sun . The days were grey and the nights black , except when lightning lit the sky above the peaks of Skagos . All of them were starved yet none could eat . The captain broached a cask of firewine to fortify the oarsmen . Sam tried a cup and sighed as hot snakes wriggled down his throat and through his chest . Dareon took a liking to the drink as well , and was seldom sober thereafter . <p> The sails went up , the sails came down , and one ripped free of the mast and flew away like a great grey bird . As Blackbird rounded the south coast of Skagos , they spotted the wreckage of a galley on the rocks . Some of her crew had washed up on the shore , and the rooks and crabs had gathered to pay them homage . " Too bloody close , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blow , and we 'll be breaking up aside them . " Exhausted as they were , his rowers bent to their oars again , and the ship clawed south toward the narrow sea , till Skagos dwindled to no more than a few dark shapes in the sky that might have been thunderheads , or the tops of tall black mountains , or both . After that , they had eight days and seven nights of clear , smooth sailing . <p> Then came more storms , worse than before . <p> Was it three storms , or only one , broken up by lulls ? Sam never knew , though he tried desperately to care . " What does it matter ? " Dareon screamed at him once , when all of them were huddled in the cabin . It does n't , Sam wanted to tell him , but so long as I 'm thinking about that I 'm not thinking about drowning or being sick or Maester Aemon 's shivering . " It does n't , " he managed to squeak , but the thunder drowned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lurched and knocked him sideways . Gilly was sobbing . The babe was shrieking . And up top he could hear Old Tattersalt bellowing at his crew , the ragged captain who never spoke at all . <p> I hate the sea , Sam thought , I hate the sea , I hate the sea , I hate the sea . The next lightning flash was so bright it lit the cabin through the seams in the planking overhead . This is a good sound ship , a good sound ship , a good ship , he told himself . It will not sink . I am not afraid . <p> During one of the lulls between the gales , as Sam clung white-knuckled to the rail wanting desperately to retch , he heard some of the crew muttering that this was what came of bringing a woman aboard ship , and a wildling woman at that . " Fucked her own father , " Sam heard one man say , as the wind was rising once again . " Worse than whoring , that . Worse than anything . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that abomination that she whelped . " <p> Sam dared not confront them . They were older men , hard and sinewy , their arms and shoulders thickened by years at the oars . But he made certain that his knife was sharp , and whenever Gilly left the cabin to make water , he went with her . <p> Even Dareon had no good to say about the wildling girl . Once , at Sam 's urging , the singer played a lullaby to soothe the babe , but partway through the first verse Gilly began to sob inconsolably . " Seven bloody hells , " Dareon snapped , " ca n't you even stop weeping long enough to hear a song ? " <p> " Just play , " Sam pleaded , " just sing the song for her . " <p> " She does n't need a song , " said Dareon . " She needs a good spanking , or maybe a hard fuck . Get out of my way , Slayer . " He shoved Sam aside and went from the cabin to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rough brotherhood of the oars . <p> Sam was at his wit 's end by then . He had almost gotten used to the smells , but between the storms and Gilly 's sobbing he had not slept for days . " Is n't there something you can give her ? " he asked Maester Aemon very softly , when he saw that the old man was awake . " Some herb or potion , so she wo n't be so afraid ? " <p> " It is not fear you hear , " the old man told him . " That is the sound of grief , and there is no potion for that . Let her tears run their course , Sam . You can not stem the flow . " <p> Sam had not understood . " She 's going to a safe place . A warm place . Why should she be grieving ? " <p> " Sam , " the old man whispered , " you have two good eyes , and yet you do not see . She is a mother grieving for her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will still be Dalla 's son , and not the child of her body . " <p> It took Sam a moment to grasp what Aemon was suggesting . " That could n't . . . she would n't . . . of course he 's hers . Gilly would never have left the Wall without her son . She loves him . " <p> " She nursed them both and loved them both , " said Aemon , " but not alike . No mother loves all her children the same , not even the Mother Above . Gilly did not leave the child willingly , I am certain . What threats the Lord Commander made , what promises , I can only guess . . . but threats and promises there surely were . " <p> " No . No , that 's wrong . Jon would never . . . " <p> " Jon would never . Lord Snow did . Sometimes there is no happy choice , Sam , only one less grievous than the others . " <p> No happy choice . Sam thought of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Keep and the death of the Old Bear , snow and ice and freezing winds , days and days and days of walking , the wights at Whitetree , Coldhands and the tree of ravens , the Wall , the Wall , the Wall , the Black Gate beneath the earth . What had it all been for ? No happy choices and no happy endings . <p> He wanted to scream . He wanted to howl and sob and shake and curl up in a little ball and whimper . He switched the babes , he told himself . He switched the babes to protect the little prince , to keep him away from Lady Melisandre 's fires , away from her red god . If she burns Gilly 's boy , who will care ? No one but Gilly . He was only Craster 's whelp , an abomination born of incest , not the son of the King-beyond-the-Wall . He 's no good for a hostage , no good for a sacrifice , no good for anything , he does n't even have a name . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retch , but there was nothing in his belly to bring up . Night had come upon them , a strange still night such as they had not seen for many days . The sea was black as glass . At the oars , the rowers rested . One or two were sleeping where they sat . The wind was in the sails , and to the north Sam could even see a scattering of stars , and the red wanderer the free folk called the Thief . That ought to be my star , Sam thought miserably . I helped to make Jon Lord Commander , and I brought him Gilly and the babe . There are no happy endings . <p> " Slayer . " Dareon appeared beside him , oblivious to Sam 's pain . " A sweet night , for once . Look , the stars are coming out . We might even get a bit of moon . Might be the worst is done . " <p> " No . " Sam wiped his nose , and pointed south with a fat finger , toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No sooner had he spoken than lightning flashed , sudden and silent and blinding bright . The distant clouds glowed for half a heartbeat , mountains heaped on mountains , purple and red and yellow , taller than the world . " The worst is n't done . The worst is just beginning , and there are no happy endings . " <p> " Gods be good , " said Dareon , laughing . " Slayer , you are such a craven. " 
@@37757002 @6757002/ <p> The dancers shimmered , their sleek shaved bodies covered with a fine sheen of oil . Blazing torches whirled from hand to hand to the beat of drums and the trilling of a flute . Whenever two torches crossed in the air , a naked girl leapt between them , spinning . The torchlight shone off oiled limbs and breasts and buttocks . <p> The three men were erect . The sight of their arousal was arousing , though Daenerys Targaryen found it comical as well . The men were all of a height , with long legs and flat bellies , every muscle as sharply etched as if it had been chiseled out of stone . Even their faces looked the same , somehow which was passing strange , since one had skin as dark as ebony , while the second was as pale as milk , and the third gleamed like burnished copper . <p> Are they meant to inflame me ? Dany stirred amongst her silken cushions . Against the pillars her Unsullied stood like statues in their spiked caps , their smooth faces expressionless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's mouth was open , and his lips glistened wetly as he watched . Hizdahr zo Loraq was saying something to the man beside him , yet all the time his eyes were on the dancing girls . The Shavepate 's ugly , oily face was as stern as ever , but he missed nothing . <p> It was harder to know what her honored guest was dreaming . The pale , lean , hawk-faced man who shared her high table was resplendent in robes of maroon silk and cloth-of-gold , his bald head shining in the torchlight as he devoured a fig with small , precise , elegant bites . Opals winked along the nose of Xaro Xhoan Daxos as his head turned to follow the dancers . In his honor Daenerys had donned a Qartheen gown , a sheer <p> confection of violet samite cut so as to leave her left breast bare . Her silver-gold hair brushed lightly over her shoulder , falling almost to her nipple . Half the men in the hall had stolen glances at her , but not Xaro . It was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prince that way . Sway him I must , however . He had come from Qarth upon the galleas Silken Cloud with thirteen galleys sailing attendance , his fleet an answered prayer . Meereen 's trade had dwindled away to nothing since she had ended slavery , but Xaro had the power to restore it . <p> As the drums reached a crescendo , three of the girls leapt above the flames , spinning in the air . The male dancers caught them about the waists and slid them down onto their members . Dany watched as the women arched their backs and coiled their legs around their partners while the flutes wept and the men thrust in time to the music . She had seen the act of love before ; the Dothraki mated as openly as their mares and stallions . This was the first time she had seen lust put to music , though . <p> Her face was warm . The wine , she told herself . Yet somehow she found herself thinking of Daario Naharis . His messenger had come that morning . The Stormcrows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her , bringing her the friendship of the Lamb Men . Food and trade , she reminded herself . He did not fail me , nor will he . Daario will help me save my city . The queen longed to see his face , to stroke his three-pronged beard , to tell him her troubles but the Stormcrows were still many days away , beyond the Khyzai Pass , and she had a realm to rule . Smoke hung between the purple pillars . The dancers knelt , heads bowed . " You were splendid , " Dany told them . " Seldom have I seen such grace , such beauty . " She beckoned to Reznak mo Reznak , and the seneschal scurried to her side . Beads of sweat dotted his bald , wrinkled head . " Escort our guests to the baths , that they may refresh themselves , and bring them food and drink . " <p> " It shall be my great honor , Magnificence . " <p> Daenerys held out her cup for Irri to refill . The wine was sweet and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much superior to the thin Ghiscari wines that had filled her cup of late . Xaro perused the fruits on the platter Jhiqui offered him and chose a persimmon . Its orange skin matched the color of the coral in his nose . He took a bite and pursed his lips . " Tart . " <p> " Would my lord prefer something sweeter ? " <p> " Sweetness cloys . Tart fruit and tart women give life its savor . " <p> Xaro took another bite , chewed , swallowed . " Daenerys , sweet queen , I can not tell you what pleasure it gives me to bask once more in your presence . A child departed Qarth , as lost as she was lovely . I feared she was sailing to her doom , yet now I find her here enthroned , mistress of an ancient city , surrounded by a mighty host that she raised up out of dreams . " <p> No , she thought , out of blood and fire . " I am glad you came to me . It is good to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will not trust you , but I need you . I need your Thirteen , I need your ships , I need your trade . For centuries Meereen and her sister cities Yunkai and Astapor had been the linchpins of the slave trade , the place where Dothraki khals and the corsairs of the Basilisk Isles sold their captives and the rest of the world came to buy . Without slaves , Meereen had little to offer traders . Copper was plentiful in the Ghiscari hills , but the metal was not as valuable as it had been when bronze ruled the world . The cedars that had once grown tall along the coast grew no more , felled by the axes of the Old Empire or consumed by dragonfire when Ghis made war against Valyria . Once the trees had gone , the soil baked beneath the hot sun and blew away in thick red clouds . " It was these calamities that transformed my people into slavers , " Galazza Galare had told her , at the Temple of the Graces . And I am the calamity that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sworn to herself . <p> " I had to come , " said Xaro in a languid tone . " Even far away in Qarth , fearful tales had reached my ears . I wept to hear them . It is said that your enemies have promised wealth and glory and a hundred virgin slave girls to any man who slays you . " <p> " The Sons of the Harpy . " How does he know that ? " They scrawl on walls by night and cut the throats of honest freedmen as they sleep . When the sun comes up they hide like roaches . They fear my Brazen Beasts . " <p> Skahaz mo Kandaq had given her the new watch she had asked for , made up in equal numbers of freedmen and shavepate Meereenese . They walked the streets both day and night , in dark hoods and brazen masks . The Sons of the Harpy had promised grisly death to any traitor who dared serve the dragon queen , and to their kith and kin as well , so the Shavepate 's men went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keeping their true faces hidden . " I might have cause to fear the Sons if they saw me wandering alone through the streets , but only if it was night and I was naked and unarmed . They are craven creatures . " <p> " A craven 's knife can slay a queen as easily as a hero 's . I would sleep more soundly if I knew my heart 's delight had kept her fierce horselords close around her . In Qarth , you had three bloodriders who never left your side . Wherever have they gone ? " <p> " Aggo , Jhoqo , and Rakharo still serve me . " He is playing games with me . Dany could play as well . " I am only a young girl and know little of such things , but older , wiser men tell me that to hold Meereen I must control its hinterlands , all the land west of Lhazar as far south as the Yunkish hills . " <p> " Your hinterlands are not precious to me . Your person is . Should any i 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " My lord is good to care so much , but I am well protected . " Dany gestured toward where Barristan Selmy stood with one hand resting on his sword hilt . " Barristan the Bold , they call him . Twice he has saved me from assassins . " <p> Xaro gave Selmy a cursory inspection . " Barristan the Old , did you say ? Your bear knight was younger , and devoted to you . " <p> " I do not wish to speak of Jorah Mormont . " <p> " To be sure . The man was coarse and hairy . " The merchant prince leaned across the table . " Let us speak instead of love , of dreams and desire and Daenerys , the fairest woman in this world . I am drunk with the sight of you . " <p> She was no stranger to the overblown courtesies of Qarth . " If you are drunk , blame the wine . " <p> " No wine is half so intoxicating as your beauty . My manse has seemed as empty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasures of the Queen of Cities have been as ashes in my mouth . Why did you abandon me ? " <p> I was hounded from your city in fear for my life . " It was time . Qarth wished me gone . " <p> " Who ? The Pureborn ? They have water in their veins . The Spicers ? <p> There are curds between their ears . And the Undying are all dead . You should have taken me to husband . I am almost certain that I asked you for your hand . Begged you , even . " <p> " Only half a hundred times , " Dany teased . " You gave up too easily , my lord . For I must marry , all agree . " <p> " A khaleesi must have a khal , " said Irri , as she filled the queen 's cup once again . " This is known . " <p> " Shall I ask again ? " wondered Xaro . " No , I know that smile . It is a cruel queen who dices with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than stones beneath your jeweled sandals . " <p> A single tear ran slowly down his pale white cheek . <p> Dany knew him too well to be moved . Qartheen men could weep at will . " Oh , stop that . " She took a cherry from the bowl on the table and threw it at his nose . " I may be a young girl , but I am not so foolish as to wed a man who finds a fruit platter more enticing than my breast . I saw which dancers you were watching . " <p> Xaro wiped away his tear . " The same ones Your Grace was following , I believe . You see , we are alike . If you will not take me for your husband , I am content to be your slave . " <p> " I want no slave . I free you . " His jeweled nose made a tempting target . This time Dany threw an apricot at him . <p> Xaro caught it in the air and took a bite . " Whence came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you did not free my own slaves when you were my guest in Qarth ? " <p> I was a beggar queen and you were Xaro of the Thirteen , Dany thought , and all you wanted were my dragons . " Your slaves seemed well treated and content . It was not till Astapor that my eyes were opened . Do you know how Unsullied are made and trained ? " <p> " Cruelly , I have no doubt . When a smith makes a sword , he thrusts the blade into the fire , beats on it with a hammer , then plunges it into iced water to temper the steel . If you would savor the sweet taste of the fruit , you must water the tree . " <p> " This tree has been watered with blood . " <p> " How else , to grow a soldier ? Your Radiance enjoyed my dancers . Would it surprise you to know that they are slaves , bred and trained in Yunkai ? They have been dancing since they were old enough to walk . How else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his wine . " They are expert in all the erotic arts as well . I had thought to make Your Grace a gift of them . " <p> " By all means . " Dany was unsurprised . " I shall free them . " <p> That made him wince . " And what would they do with freedom ? As well give a fish a suit of mail . They were made to dance . " <p> " Perhaps your elephants would sooner be nightingales . Instead of sweet song , Meereen 's nights would be filled with thunderous trumpetings , and your trees would shatter beneath the weight of great grey birds . " Xaro sighed . " Daenerys , my delight , beneath that sweet young breast beats a tender heart but take counsel from an older , wiser head . Things are not always as they seem . Much that may seem evil can be good . Consider rain . " <p> " Rain ? " Does he take me for a fool , or just a child ? " We curse the rain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we should starve . The world needs rain and slaves . You make a face , but it is true . Consider Qarth . In art , music , magic , trade , all that makes us more than beasts , Qarth sits above the rest of mankind as you sit at the summit of this pyramid but below , in place of bricks , the magnificence that is the Queen of Cities rests upon the backs of slaves . Ask yourself , if all men must grub in the dirt for food , how shall any man lift his eyes to contemplate the stars ? If each of us must break his back to build a hovel , who shall raise the temples to glorify the gods ? For some men to be great , others must be enslaved . " <p> He was too eloquent for her . Dany had no answer for him , only the raw feeling in her belly . " Slavery is not the same as rain , " she insisted . " I have been rained on and I have been sold . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be owned . " <p> Xaro gave a languid shrug . " As it happens , when I came ashore in your sweet city , I chanced to see upon the riverbank a man who had once been a guest in my manse , a merchant who dealt in rare spices and choice wines . He was naked from the waist up , red and peeling , and seemed to be digging a hole . " <p> " Not a hole . A ditch , to bring water from the river to the fields . We mean to plant beans . The beanfields must have water . " <p> " How kind of my old friend to help with the digging . And how very unlike him . Is it possible he was given no choice in the matter ? No , surely not . You have no slaves in Meereen . " <p> Dany flushed . " Your friend is being paid with food and shelter . I can not give him back his wealth . Meereen needs beans more than it needs rare spices , and beans require @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to digging ditches as well ? Sweet queen , when he saw me , my old friend fell to his knees and begged me to buy him as a slave and take him back to Qarth . " <p> She felt as if he 'd slapped her . " Buy him , then . " <p> " If it please you . I know it will please him . " He put his hand upon her arm . " There are truths only a friend may tell you . I helped you when you came to Qarth a beggar , and I have crossed long leagues and stormy seas to help you once again . Is there some place where we might speak frankly ? " <p> Dany could feel the warmth of his fingers . He was warm in Qarth as well , she recalled , until the day he had no more use for me . She rose to her feet . " Come , " she said , and Xaro followed her through the pillars , to the wide marble steps that led up to her private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh most beautiful of women , " Xaro said , as they began to climb , " there are footsteps behind us . We are followed . " <p> " My old knight does not frighten you , surely ? Ser Barristan is sworn to keep my secrets . " <p> She took him out onto the terrace that overlooked the city . A full moon swam in the black sky above Meereen . " Shall we walk ? " Dany slipped her arm through his . The air was heavy with the scent of night-blooming flowers . " You spoke of help . Trade with me , then . Meereen has salt to sell , and wine " <p> " Ghiscari wine ? " Xaro made a sour face . " The sea provides all the salt that Qarth requires , but I would gladly take as many olives as you cared to sell me . Olive oil as well . " <p> " I have none to offer . The slavers burned the trees . " Olives had been grown along the shores of Slaver 's Bay for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the torch as Dany 's host advanced on them , leaving her to cross a blackened wasteland . " We are replanting , but it takes seven years before an olive tree begins to bear , and thirty years before it can truly be called productive . What of copper ? " <p> " A pretty metal , but fickle as a woman . Gold , now gold is sincere . Qarth will gladly give you gold for slaves . " <p> " Meereen is a free city of free men . " <p> " A poor city that once was rich . A hungry city that once was fat . A bloody city that once was peaceful . " <p> His accusations stung . There was too much truth in them . " Meereen will be rich and fat and peaceful once again , and free as well . Go to the Dothraki if you must have slaves . " <p> " Dothraki make slaves , Ghiscari train them . And to reach Qarth , the horselords must needs drive their captives across the red waste . Hundreds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which is why no khal will risk it . And there is this : Qarth wants no khalasars seething round our walls . The stench of all those horses meaning no offense , Khaleesi . " <p> " A horse has an honest smell . That is more than can be said of some great lords and merchant princes . " <p> Xaro took no notice of the sally . " Daenerys , let me be honest with you , as befits a friend . You will not make Meereen rich and fat and peaceful . You will only bring it to destruction , as you did Astapor . You are aware that there was battle joined at the Horns of Hazzat ? The Butcher King has fled back to his palace , his new Unsullied running at his heels . " <p> " This is known . " Brown Ben Plumm had sent back word of the battle from the field . " The Yunkai'i have bought themselves new sellswords , and two legions from New Ghis fought beside them . " <p> " Two will soon become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent to Myr and Volantis to hire more blades . The Company of the Cat , the Long Lances , the Windblown . Some say that the Wise Masters have bought the Golden Company as well . " <p> Her brother Viserys had once feasted the captains of the Golden Company , in hopes they might take up his cause . They ate his food and heard his pleas and laughed at him . Dany had only been a little girl , but she remembered . " I have sellswords too . " <p> " Two companies . The Yunkai'i will send twenty against you if they must . And when they march , they will not march alone . Tolos and Mantarys have agreed to an alliance . " <p> That was i 'll news , if true . Daenerys had sent missions to Tolos and Mantarys , hoping to find new friends to the west to balance the enmity of Yunkai to the south . Her envoys had not returned . " Meereen has made alliance with Lhazar . " <p> That only made him chuckle . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you shear them , all they do is bleat . They are not a martial people . " <p> Even a sheepish friend is better than none . " The Wise Masters should follow their example . I spared Yunkai before , but I will not make that mistake again . If they should dare attack me , this time I shall raze their Yellow City to the ground . " <p> " And whilst you are razing Yunkai , my sweet , Meereen shall rise behind you . Do not close your eyes to your peril , Daenerys . Your eunuchs are fine soldiers , but they are too few to match the hosts that Yunkai will send against you , once Astapor has fallen . " <p> He was wrong in that , she hoped . The freedmen had been a rabble once , but she had organized the men of fighting age into companies and commanded Grey Worm to make them into soldiers . Let him think what he will . " Have you forgotten ? I have dragons . " <p> " Do you ? In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your shoulder yet now that shapely shoulder is as fair and bare as your sweet breast , I observe . " <p> " My dragons have grown , my shoulders have not . They range far afield , hunting . " Hazzea , forgive me . She wondered how much Xaro knew , what whispers he had heard . " Ask the Good Masters of Astapor about my dragons if you doubt them . " I saw a slaver ' s eyes melt and go running down his cheeks . " Tell me true , old friend , why did you seek me out if not to trade ? " <p> " To bring a gift , for the queen of my heart . " <p> " Say on . " What trap is this , now ? " The gift you begged of me in Qarth . Ships . There are thirteen galleys in the bay . Yours , if you will have them . I have brought you a fleet , to carry you home to Westeros . " <p> A fleet . It was more than she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wary . In Qarth , Xaro had offered her thirty ships for a dragon . " And what price do you ask for these ships ? " <p> " None . I no longer lust for dragons . I saw their work at Astapor on my way here , when my Silken Cloud put in for water . The ships are yours , sweet queen . Thirteen galleys , and men to pull the oars . " <p> Thirteen . To be sure . Xaro was one of the Thirteen . No doubt he had convinced each of his fellow members to give up one ship . She knew the merchant prince too well to think that he would sacrifice thirteen of his own ships . " I must consider this . May I inspect these ships ? " <p> " You have grown suspicious , Daenerys . " <p> Always . " I have grown wise , Xaro . " <p> " Inspect all you wish . When you are satisfied , swear to me that you shall return to Westeros forthwith , and the ships are yours . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ashes of your fathers , and go . " <p> " And if I should decide to wait a year , or three ? " <p> A mournful look crossed Xaro 's face .

" <p> He offers the honeycomb with one hand and shows the whip with the other . " The Yunkai'i are not so fearsome as all that . " <p> " Not all your enemies are in the Yellow City . Beware men with cold hearts and blue lips . You had not been gone from Qarth a fortnight when Pyat Pree set out with three of his fellow warlocks , to seek for you in Pentos .

" <p> " And what is it that you fear , sweet queen ? " <p> " I am only a foolish young girl . " Dany rose on her toes and kissed his cheek . " But not so foolish as to tell you that . My men shall look at these ships . Then you shall have my answer . " <p> " As you say . " He touched her bare breast lightly , and whispered , <p> " Let me stay and help persuade you .

It had taken three to carry her and her khalasar from Qarth to Astapor , but that was before she had acquired eight thousand Unsullied , a thousand sellswords , and a vast horde of freedmen . And the dragons , what am I to do with them ? " Drogon , " she whispered softly , " where are you ? " For a moment she could almost see him sweeping across the sky , his black wings swallowing the stars . <p> She turned her back upon the night , to where Barristan Selmy stood silent in the shadows . " My brother once told me a Westerosi riddle . Who listens to everything yet hears nothing ? " <p> " A knight of the Kingsguard . " Selmy 's voice was solemn . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did , Your Grace . " The old knight took pains not to look at her bare breast as he spoke to her . <p> Ser Jorah would not turn his eyes away . He loved me as a woman , where Ser Barristan loves me only as his queen . Mormont had been an informer , reporting to her enemies in Westeros , yet he had given her good counsel too . " What do you think of it ? Of him ? " <p> " Of him , little and less . These ships , though Your Grace , with these ships we might be home before year 's end . " <p> Dany had never known a home . In Braavos , there had been a house with a red door , but that was all . " Beware of Qartheen bearing gifts , especially merchants of the Thirteen . There is some trap here . Perhaps these ships are rotten , or " <p> " If they were so unseaworthy , they could not have crossed the sea from Qarth , " Ser Barristan pointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon inspection . I will take Admiral Groleo to the galleys at first light with his captains and two score of his sailors . We can crawl over every inch of those ships . " <p> It was good counsel . " Yes , make it so . " Westeros . Home . But if she left , what would happen to her city ? Meereen was never your city , her brother 's voice seemed to whisper . Your cities are across the sea . Your Seven Kingdoms , where your enemies await you . You were born to serve them blood and fire . <p> Ser Barristan cleared his throat and said , " This warlock that the merchant spoke of " <p> " Pyat Pree . " She tried to recall his face , but all she could see were his lips . The wine of the warlocks had turned them blue . <p> Shade-of-the-evening , it was called . " If a warlock 's spell could kill me , I would be dead by now . I left their palace all in ashes . " Drogon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . Drogon burned them all . <p> " As you say , Your Grace . Still . I will be watchful . " <p> She kissed him on the cheek . " I know you will . Come , walk me back down to the feast . " <p> The next morning Dany woke as full of hope as she had been since first she came to Slaver 's Bay . Daario would soon be at her side once more , and together they would sail for Westeros . For home . One of her young hostages brought her morning meal , a plump shy girl named Mezzara , whose father ruled the pyramid of Merreq , and Dany gave her a happy hug and thanked her with a kiss . <p> " Xaro Xhoan Daxos has offered me thirteen galleys , " she told Irri and Jhiqui as they were dressing her for court . <p> " Thirteen is a bad number , Khaleesi , " murmured Jhiqui , in the Dothraki tongue . " It is known . " <p> The two Dothraki girls exchanged a look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Irri . " Horses can not drink it . " <p> " I do not intend to drink it , " Dany promised them . <p> Only four petitioners awaited her that morning . As ever , Lord Ghael was the first to present himself , looking even more wretched than usual . <p> " Your Radiance , " he moaned , as he fell to the marble at her feet , " the armies of the Yunkai'i descend on Astapor . I beg you , come south with all your strength ! " <p> " I warned your king that this war of his was folly , " Dany reminded him . " He would not listen . " <p> " Great Cleon sought only to strike down the vile slavers of Yunkai . " <p> " Great Cleon is a slaver himself . " <p> " I know that the Mother of Dragons will not abandon us in our hour of peril . Lend us your Unsullied to defend our walls . " <p> And if I do , who will defend my walls ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some will wish to help defend your king . That is their choice , as free men . I gave Astapor its freedom . It is up to you to defend it . " <p> " We are all dead , then . You gave us death , not freedom . " Ghael leapt to his feet and spat into her face . <p> Strong Belwas seized him by the shoulder and slammed him down onto the marble so hard that Dany heard Ghael 's teeth crack . The Shavepate would have done worse , but she stopped him . <p> " Enough , " she said , dabbing at her cheek with the end of her tokar . <p> " No one has ever died from spittle . Take him away . " <p> They dragged him out feet first , leaving several broken teeth and a trail of blood behind . Dany would gladly have sent the rest of the petitioners away but she was still their queen , so she heard them out and did her best to give them justice . <p> Late that afternoon Admiral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ galleys . Dany assembled her council to hear them . Grey Worm was there for the Unsullied , Skahaz mo Kandaq for the Brazen Beasts . In the absence of her bloodriders , a wizened jaqqa rhan called Rommo , squint-eyed and bowlegged , came to speak for her Dothraki . Her freedmen were represented by the captains of the three companies she had formedMollono Yos Dob of the Stalwart Shields , Symon Stripe-back of the Free Brothers , Marselen of the Mother 's Men . Reznak mo Reznak hovered at the queen 's elbow , and Strong Belwas stood behind her with his huge arms crossed . Dany would not lack for counsel . <p> Groleo had been a most unhappy man since they had broken up his ship to build the siege engines that won Meereen for her . Dany had tried to console him by naming him her lord admiral , but it was a hollow honor ; the Meereenese fleet had sailed for Yunkai when Dany 's host approached the city , so the old Pentoshi was an admiral without ships . Yet now he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the queen could scarce remember . <p> " The ships are sound , then ? " she said , hoping . " Sound enough , Your Grace .

The Narraqqa could stand a new rudder and lines , and the Banded Lizard has some cracked oars , but they will serve . The rowers are slaves , but if we offer them an honest oarsman 's wage , most will stay with us . Rowing 's all they know . Those who leave can be replaced from my own crews . It is a long hard voyage to Westeros , but these ships are sound enough to get us there , I 'd judge . " <p> Reznak mo Reznak gave a piteous moan . " Then it is true . Your Worship means to abandon us . " He wrung his hands . " The Yunkai'i will restore the Great Masters the instant you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your cause will be put to the sword , our sweet wives and maiden daughters raped and enslaved . " <p> " Not mine , " grumbled Skahaz Shavepate . " I will kill them first , with mine own hand . " He slapped his sword hilt . <p> Dany felt as if he had slapped her face instead . " If you fear what may follow when I leave , come with me to Westeros . " <p> " Wherever the Mother of Dragons goes , the Mother 's Men will go as well , " announced Marselen , Missandei 's remaining brother . <p> " How ? " asked Symon Stripeback , named for the tangle of scars that ridged his back and shoulders , a reminder of the whippings he had suffered as a slave in Astapor . " Thirteen ships that 's not enough . A hundred ships might not be enough . " <p> " Wooden horses are no good , " objected Rommo , the old jaqqa rhan . <p> " Dothraki will ride . " <p> " These ones could march overland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The ships could keep pace and resupply the column . " <p> " That might serve until you reached the ruins of Bhorash , " said the Shavepate . " Beyond that , your ships would need to turn south past Tolos and the Isle of Cedars and sail around Valyria , whilst the foot continued on to Mantarys by the old dragon road . " <p> " The demon road , they call it now , " said Mollono Yos Dob . The plump commander of the Stalwart Shields looked more like a scribe than a soldier , with his inky hands and heavy paunch , but he was as clever as they came . " Many and more of us would die . " <p> " Those left behind in Meereen would envy them their easy deaths , " <p> moaned Reznak . " They will make slaves of us , or throw us in the pits . All will be as it was , or worse . " <p> " Where is your courage ? " Ser Barristan lashed out . " Her Grace freed you from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swords and defend your own freedom when she leaves . " <p> " Brave words , from one who means to sail into the sunset , " Symon Stripeback snarled back . " Will you look back at our dying ? " <p> " Your Grace " <p> " Magnificence " <p> " Your Worship " <p> " Enough . " Dany slapped the table . " No one will be left to die . You are all my people . " Her dreams of home and love had blinded her . " I will not abandon Meereen to the fate of Astapor . It grieves me to say so , but Westeros must wait . " <p> Groleo was aghast . " We must accept these ships . If we refuse this gift " <p> Ser Barristan went to one knee before her . " My queen , your realm has need of you . You are not wanted here , but in Westeros men will flock to your banners by the thousands , great lords and noble knights . She is come , ' they will shout to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sister has come home at last . ' " <p> " If they love me so much , they will wait for me . " Dany stood . <p> " Reznak , summon Xaro Xhoan Daxos . " <p> She received the merchant prince alone , seated on her bench of polished ebony , on the cushions Ser Barristan had brought her . Four Qartheen sailors accompanied him , bearing a rolled tapestry upon their shoulders . " I have brought another gift for the queen of my heart , " Xaro announced . " It has been in my family vaults since before the Doom that took Valyria . " <p> The sailors unrolled the tapestry across the floor . It was old , dusty , faded and huge . Dany had to move to Xaro 's side before the patterns became plain . " A map ? It is beautiful . " It covered half the floor . The seas were blue , the lands were green , the mountains black and brown . Cities were shown as stars in gold or silver thread . There is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an island . <p> " There you see Astapor , and Yunkai , and Meereen . " Xaro pointed at three silver stars beside the blue of Slaver 's Bay . " Westeros is <p> somewhere down there . " His hand waved vaguely toward the far end of the hall . " You turned north when you should have continued south and west , across the Summer Sea , but with my gift you shall soon be back where you belong . Accept my galleys with a joyful heart , and bend your oars westward . " <p> Would that I could . " My lord , I will gladly have those ships , but I can not give you the promise that you ask . " She took his hand . " Give me the galleys , and I swear that Qarth will have the friendship of Meereen until the stars go out . Let me trade with them , and you will have a good part of the profits . " <p> Xaro 's glad smile died upon his lips . " What are you saying ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " I can not go .

One day , she promised herself . <p> The next morning Xaro 's galleas was gone , but the " gift " that he had brought her remained behind in Slaver 's Bay .

@@37757003 @6757003/ <p> " You may as well stop complaining about it . Its your responsibility as a Lycan alpha , and there 's no way to get out of it . " Larssen sat calmly in the comm seat , executing a maneuver that would take them through a wormhole to the Andromeda Galaxy . They could then travel to their destination , Lycanus 2 , a sister planet to their own Lycanus 3 . Unlike stargates , the wormholes werent permanent . Their connections lasted only for a short time , usually sixteen to forty-eight hours , and collapsed if too much mass passed through them . Their ship was small and fast , but it still took almost a full day of travel time to get through to the other side . <p> " Well , it may be my responsibility , and I 'm fucking doing it . But I do n't  have to like it , " Konnor grumbled . Hed been in a foul mood since Lucas , his pack alpha and his first cousin , told him hed been chosen to preside over the Selection , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pack . <p> Konnor and his brother Larssen had been selected to serve on the Hierarchy Panel , an important duty that enabled them to select the new leaders while providing a smooth transition from childhood to adulthoodby deciding on each pups rank in the Lycan hierarchy . In their ancient history challenges and fights decided rank . The intense battles among the young pups , as the applicants were called , had sometimes led to unfortunate deaths , especially among the extremely dominant alphas who refused to yield . <p> As Lycan wolf-shifters , rank was everything . The alphas were the controlling and sovereign leaders of the packs , assisted by their seconds in command , the powerful betas . The gammas were the soldiers , still forceful , as all wolf-shifters were , but they were the followers , comfortable in their roles as followers and rank and file . The lowest ranking , most submissive of the Lycans were the omegas . Omegas were rare , and thought by the Ruling Council to be slightly defective , good enough for only two thingsservice and fucking . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the pack . Sometimes the gammas chose them , but if they were good-looking , then one of the dominant alphas usually took them on as their concubines and personal submissives . <p> It was an important but arduous process to determine the pups ranks , and one that the alphas took seriously . Each alpha had a duty to take his rotation as a judge . When Lucas called Konnor into his office to break the news to him , however , hed still been apologetic . <p> " Sorry , Konnor , but it looks l ike yourand Larssens numbers have come up . The Ruling Council on Lycanus 2 has requested I send two of my alphas right away to participate in the Selection . Since Nikolai is still on his honeymoon , and Kyle and Blayde are both busy in different parts of the galaxy on their transports , all I have left is you and Larssen . " <p> " Gods , Lucas , I 'm supposed to be taking a little rest and relaxation here . Larssen and I have had three transports and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , Konnor , and I hate to ask you both , but its out of my hands . The Ruling Council is demanding your presence . Weve been able to dodge their summons for a few cycles , but this time I have no choice but to send you both . " <p> Alphas were comparatively rare , though Lucas family on Lycanus 3 had been cursed with not one but six alphas , all closely related . Their greatgrandfathers concubine , a powerful warlock , had cursed the Balenescu family to have nothing but alpha male children . This was somewhat disastrous , as alphas simply could not live together in harmony . Luckily , only one of them , his cousin Lucas , was interested in leading the pack . The others became either bounty hunters , like Konnor , Larssen , and their cousin Blayde , or Voyagers like Kyle and Nikolai , delivering bauxite , their planets export , to planetary systems all over the galaxies . This enabled them to make their homes on Lycanus 3 but also to not be around a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to remain close without rippingout each others throat . Blayde and Nikolai had recently found their mates , and this also helped to tone down some of the aggressive competition among them . <p> Konnor was only twenty-three , and hoped the other part of the family curse , the one that had to do with finding their mates , did n't  touch him for a long time . Konnor had no desire to become as besotted as Blayde and Nikolai , and be tied down to one mate for the rest of his very long life . Waiting another ten years would be just fine with him , and give him a chance to fully explore the galaxies , along with exploring his very dominant nature . <p> All alphas were dominant , but unlike his cousins , Konnor was an alpha who not only had a streak of sadism , but who also required his partners to be extremely submissive . Since he traveled so much , hed actually given serious thought to purchasing a love slave from one of the many auctions throughout the galaxy . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one his cousin Blayde had mated , but so long as they were on their knees and knew how to properly serve their masters , he was okay with other species too , like Nikolais gorgeous , exotic Jayronian . Not that Nikolais little Jayronian prince was particularly submissive . He had led Nikolai a merry chase during their courtship . <p> The only thing that stopped him from buying a love slave was the fucking curse his family was all under , thanks to that crazy old man his great-grandfather mated so long ago . Since Konnor was twenty-three , his number might be up soon . A love slave would then turn into a liability , because not only had the bastard cursed all the descendants to be alphas , but he had also fixed it so they would find their mates while they were really young . Even worse , once they found their mates , they would be irrevocably , passionately , wildly in love with them , and find themselves unable to be away from them for longer than a day or two . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Possession , protection , and discipline for your submissive mate were all fine , and to be expected . But love ? Love was for other people , but not him . Love only complicated an otherwise straightforward relationship . <p> " Lucas said there were about ten of them . " <p> " Huh ? Ten what ? " Konnor had been so deep in thought hed lost the thread of their conversation . " Oh , the pups ? And how many alpha judges ? " <p> " Tenone pup for each of us . That should make it go a lot faster . Well be able to really observe them well , and put them through their paces , though alphas are usually pretty easy to spot . They 're the ones who growl back at you and show their teeth when you try to dominate them , " he said with a laugh . " I hope we get a couple of those and then we can be on our way . " The young pups were all around the ages of seventeen and eighteen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the age of puberty , which came extremely late for Lycans . Perhaps because of their long lives , sometimes over two or three hundred cycles , most male Lycans did n't  become fully grown until their late teens . Until about eighteen , most males lived at home with their parents , but when they hit puberty , they were expected to go through the Selection , which would decide their paths in life . From that moment on , they were considered fully adult and independent . <p> Alphas were put into tactical leadership training , betas were given educations in finance and psychology in preparation for becoming the bookkeepers and counselors of their packs , and gammas were put into some kind of apprenticeship with one of the packs , either on their home planet or on one of the other Lycan planets , wherever they were most needed . As for the omegas , if there were any , they would be put into submissive training and then put up for bidding as love slaves . Since they were still Lycan , they would be sold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alpha leaders would ensure they received good homes . Though all other Lycans were dominants , they took good care of their own .

I 'm going to try to get a little sleep before my turn at the controls , " Konnor said . <p> " Yeah , maybe youd better . I hear the nightlife on Lycan 2 can be wild . " <p> " Good . Maybe this trip wont be a total waste after all . " <p> Konnor lay back in his seat on the comm deck , dropping almost immediately into a drowsy , half sleep . Used to grabbing a nap whenever they had a chance , he and his family were all experts at falling asleep quickly on a long voyage . Because of the wormholes instability , one of them needed to stay at the controls , and since it was Larssens turn , Konnor settled back to get comfortable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought about what Larssen had just said . The nightlife on Lycan 2 was renowned throughout the galaxy , and that was saying something . Unlike the insular home planet of Lycanus , Lycanus 2 and 3 were much more socialized and open to visits from other species . Lycanus 2 , in particular , had made an industry of providing pleasure . Not only did the planet boast beautiful mountains , waterfalls and rivers , but the southern hemisphere had arguably the best beaches in this part of the galaxy . The Amarinthine Ocean , with its purple , warm-asbathwater seas was Konnors favorite vacation spot , its black volcanic sands the perfect place to sunbathe under the twin suns . <p> But the Ruling Councilhadnt forgotten the nightlife . Their planet boasted some of the best D/s clubs anywhere in this part of the galaxy . He planned to check one of them out at the earliest opportunity .

The rest of the world was made up of idiots and mediocrities . The Humans , she called them . <p> ( God being dead , irony still rollickingly alive ... ) <p> Later , courtesy of my psycho-terrorist Catholic Aunt Theresa , I discovered I was also a Dirty Little Girl . A Dirty , Filthy Little Girl , to be precise . When I was eight she caught me and Toby Greely in the basement examining each others private parts . One minute Toby and I were alone , watched by the rooms stunned miscellany cardboard boxes and a broken ping-pong table and some rolled-up sunshades the next the silence shifted and I knew someone else was there . Aunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always moist from Ponds Cold Cream but right then it shone with what looked like newly minted divinity . My face , when I turned it to her , was hot and overfull .

I 'd been close to some big revelation , I believed , and along with horror at being discovered was queenly annoyance at being interrupted . Even then I was thinking Toby and I would have to get back to this , soon . <p> The Dirty Filthy Little Girl was pretty and liked bad things . In Tenth Grade she was friends with Lauren Miller , who was also pretty and also liked bad things . For example there was a drippy and permanently cold-sored girl they tormented and nicknamed NODOR ( No Danger of Rape ) . One day the Dirty Filthy Little Girl was sitting on Jason Wellss lap at recess and Lauren called out something awful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from NODORs face it really hurt her , hurt her in her heart , and at the same time Jasons hard-on was pressing against the Dirty Filthy Little Girls ass and the Dirty Filthy Little Girl got the rich soft feeling again and knew there was a connection . It was like the Devil putting his arms around you from behind and you leaning back into it and enjoying the lovely surprising warmth . <p> At college the Very Bad Dirty Filthy Little Girl knew once and for all she was an agent for the forces of darkness . She was the worst kind of young woman : one who recognised the proactively politicised female she ought to become , then did n't  become it , but instead carried on being attracted to evil guys and having the wrong kind of sexual fantasies and making herself look as attractive as possible and ultimately accepting that she was too selfish and good-looking and lazy and perverted to ever live the kind of life she knew she ought to .

A servant of Mammon ! With no great surprise in fact with loose-limbed satisfaction she discovered she had a penchant for what a later lover ( the lover to end all lovers ) would call the smut and savvy of American Trade . Her mother was both disappointed and sufficiently vain to be flattered by how much like her her daughter had turned out . <p> Given the Very Bad Dirty Filthy Little Girls record , it was astonishing that when her marriage collapsed it was n't because she was cheating on her husband , but because he was cheating on her . She enjoyed a brief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the operative word . No sooner had she got used to the toothsome satisfaction of being all sorts of lousy things but at least I 'm not a fucking liar you miserable fuck than she got bitten by a werewolf one night in the Arizona desert , and was forced to say goodbye to the moral high ground for ever . She discovered that not only could she kill and eat people once a month , but she could kill and eat people once a month and love it . <p> Until she found out she was pregnant .

The extra weight he was bearing , though not all that substantial , was awkwardly placed , and the terrain was uneven . It was never an easy thing to tote a dead body through the woods in the middle of the night . He shifted the corpse to his left shoulder and trudged on . The soles of his shoes bore no distinguishing marks ; not that it would have mattered , since the rain quickly washed away any traces of footprints . He 'd checked the forecast ; the rain was why he was here . The inclement weather was the best friend he could ask for . <p> Aside from the dead body draped over his sturdy shoulder , the man was also remarkable for the black hood he wore , on which was stitched an esoteric symbol that ran down the length of the cloth .

He took a deep breath and held it as he undid the telephone wire holding the bundle closed , and unwrapped the plastic . She was young with features that had been attractive two days prior ; the woman was not much to look at now . The soft blond hair fell away from the greenish-tinged skin , revealing closed eyes and bloated cheeks .

The body 's rigor mortis , though rapidly fading , had made the task difficult , but he was strong and had finally levered the stiffened limb to the correct angle . He took the watch out of his pocket , checked with his flashlight to make sure it was set properly , and placed it around the dead woman 's wrist . <p> Though far from a religious man , he knelt over the body and muttered a brief prayer , cupping his hand over his mouth and nose as he did so . <p> " You were n't directly responsible , but you were all I had .

In the dull , misty night the woman seemed surrounded by a yellowish glow , as though she 'd already become a spirit . <p> He drew farther back and examined the area all around , checking for any extraneous items that might lead to evidence against him .

There were sounds from the other side of the inn , too , the murmur of voices on the Green , geese honking , the rumble of a wagon . What was on the horses , he left ; this would be a short stop .

It all seemed smaller than it had , somehow . The tallbacked chairs in front of the fireplace were where the Village Council met . Brandelwyn al'Vere 's books sat on a shelf opposite the fireplace once , Perrin had been unable to imagine more books in one place than those few dozen mostly worn volumes and casks of ale and wine lined another wall .

Sometimes it was like Healing ; Moghedien had never been interested in much that could not advance her , preferably by shortcuts . The woman was hardly likely to reveal the truth , but Nynaeve suspected she had been some sort of swindler or the like before swearing her soul over to the Dark One . Sometimes she and Elayne just did not know the questions to ask . Moghedien seldom volunteered anything , that was certain . Even so , they had learned a great deal , and passed most on to the Aes Sedai . As results of their researches and studies as Accepted , of course . They had gained a lot of credit . <p> She and Elayne would have kept knowledge of her to themselves if they could , but Birgitte had known from the start , and Siuan and Leane had to be told . Siuan had known enough of the circumstances that led to Moghediens capture to demand a full explanation , and had the leverage to obtain one . Nynaeve and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to know all of her and Elaynes except the truth about Birgitte . It made for a precarious balance , with the advantage to Siuan and Leane .

The only way to pass those on was to make them seem to have come from Siuan and Leanes agents . Nothing about the Black Ajahhidden deep and long deniedthough that interested Siuan most . Darkfriends disgusted her , but the very idea of Aes Sedai swearing themselves to the Dark One was enough to screw Siuans anger to an icy rage . Moghedien claimed to have been afraid to go near any Aes Sedai , and that was believable enough . Fear was a permanent part of the woman . No wonder she had hidden in the shadows enough to be called the Spider . All in all , she was a treasure trove too valuable to give to the headsman , yet most Aes Sedai would not see it so . Most Aes Sedai might refuse to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and revulsion stabbed Nynaeve , not for the first time . Could any amount of knowledge justify keeping one of the Forsaken from justice ? Turning her in meant punishment , probably dreadful , for everyone involved , not just herself , but Elayne and Siuan and Leane . Turning her in meant Birgittes secret would come out . And all that knowledge lost . Moghedien might know nothing of Healing , but she had given Nynaeve a dozen hints of what was possible , and there had to be more in her head . With those to guide her , what might she discover eventually ? <p> Nynaeve wanted a bath , and it had nothing to do with the heat . " We will talk about the weather , " she said bitterly . <p> " You know more about controlling weather than I do . " Moghedien sounded weary , and an echo slid through the bracelet .

" Then well talk about using different weaves to Heal different illnesses . " The woman said that took more time than what was done now , but all the strength for it came from the Power , not from the patient and the woman channeling . Of course , she said men had actually been better at some kinds of Healing , and Nynaeve was not about to believe that . " You must have seen it done at least once .

Or trying to play with them . Jaril and Seve stared at the woman in her odd wide yellow trousers and short dark coat , but they showed no more reaction than that . They never did , and they never spoke . They were supposed to be " Marigans " children . Birgitte was happy playing with them , and a touch sad ; she always liked playing with children , especially little boys , and she always felt that way when she did . Elayne knew it as well as she knew her own feelings . <p> If she had thought Moghedien had anything to do with their condition . . . .

And Rand . There had to be some way to handle this . Barely seeing Birgittes return nod , she hurried up the alley and out onto the main street of Salidar beneath a cloudless , broiling midday sky . <p> For years Salidar had stood abandoned , before Aes Sedai fleeing Elaidas coup began to gather there , but now fresh thatch topped the houses , most of which showed considerable new repairs and patches , and the three large stone buildings that had been inns . One , the largest , was called the Little Tower by some ; that was where the Hall met . Only what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glass filled many windows , or none . More important matters were afoot than repointing stonework or painting . The dirt streets were filled to bursting . Not just with Aes Sedai , of course , but Accepted in banded dresses and scurrying novices in pure white , Warders moving with the deadly grace of leopards whether lean or bulky , servants who had followed Aes Sedai from the Tower , even a few children . And soldiers . <p> The Hall here was preparing to enforce its claims against Elaida by arms if necessary , just as soon as they chose a true Amyrlin Seat . The distant clang of hammers , cutting through the crowds murmur from forges outside the village , spoke of horses being shod , armor being mended . A square-faced man , his dark hair heavy with gray , went riding slowly down the street in a buff-colored coat and battered breastplate . Picking his way through the crowd , he eyed marching clusters of men with long pikes on their shoulders , or bows . Gareth Bryne had agreed to recruit and lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the full how and why . Something to do with Siuan and Leane , though what , she could not imagine , since he ran both women ragged , especially Siuan , fulfilling some oath Elayne did not have the straight of either .

" Rand said impatiently , tying Jeade'en 's reins to one wheel of the last wagon in line . <p> She was standing on tiptoe to peer over the side of the wagonbed at a pair of casks that seemed familiar . Unless he was mistaken , they held the two cuendillar seals , packed in wool for protection now that they were no longer unbreakable . He felt the Dark One 's taint strongly here ; it almost seemed to come from the casks , a faint miasma as from something rotting in a hidden place . <p> " It will be safe here , " Moiraine murmured . Lifting her skirts gracefully , she started up the line of wagons . Lan heeled her , a halftame wolf , the cloak hanging down his back all disturbing ripples of color and nothingness . <p> Rand glared . " Did she tell you what it was , Egwene ? " <p> " Just that you had to see something . That you had to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aes Sedai , " Aviendha said , almost as levelly , but with a hint of doubt .

Time seemed to slow , everything happening at once , as if the air were jelly clinging to each moment . <p> Lanfear stepped out into stunned silence except for the moans and screams of the injured , something limp and pale and redstreaked hanging from her hand , dragging behind her as she walked down invisible steps . Her face was a mask carved of ice . " He told me , Lews Therin , " she almost screamed , flinging the pale thing into the air . Something caught it , inflated it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Hadnan Kadere ; his skin , removed whole . The figure collapsed and fell as Lanfear 's voice rose to a screech . " You let another woman touch you ! Again ! " <p> Moments clinging , all happening at once . <p> Before Lanfear reached the stones of the quay , Moiraine lifted her skirts higher and began running straight toward her . Quick as she was , Lan was quicker , ignoring her shout of , " No , Lan ! " Sword coming out , long legs carried him ahead of her , colorshifting cloak waving behind as he charged . Suddenly he seemed to run into an invisible stone wall , bounce back , try to stagger forward again . One step , and as if a giant hand had smashed him aside , he flew ten paces through the air , crashing to the stones . <p> While he was in midair , Moiraine jerked forward , feet skidding along the pavement , until she was face to face with Lanfear . It was only for a moment . The Forsaken looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , then Moiraine was flung to one side so hard she rolled over and over until she disappeared beneath one of the wagons . <p> The quayside was in turmoil . Just moments since Kadere 's wagon erupted , yet only the blind could not know the One Power was being wielded by the woman in white . Along the docks axes flashed , cutting ropes , freeing barges as their crews desperately fended the craft toward open water and flight . Barechested dockmen and darkclothed townsfolk struggled to jump aboard . In the other direction men and women milled and screamed as they fought to pass through the gates into the city . And among them , cadin'sorclad figures veiled themselves and rushed at Lanfear with spears or knives or bare hands . There could be no doubt she was the source of the attack , no doubt she fought with the Power . They ran to dance the spears regardless . <p> Fire rolled over them in waves . Arrows of it pierced those who came on with their clothes in flames . It was not as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real mind . She might have been brushing aside gnats or bitemes .

She moved toward Rand as if nothing else existed . <p> Heartbeats only . <p> Three steps she had taken when Rand seized the male half of the True Source , molten steel and steelshattering ice , sweet honey and midden heap . Deep in the Void , the fight for survival was distant , the battle before him scarcely less . As Moiraine vanished beneath the wagon , he channeled , pulling the heat from Lanfear 's fires , sinking it into the river . Flames that a moment before engulfed human forms , vanished . In the same instant he wove the flows again , and a misty gray dome came into being , a long oval enclosing him and Lanfear and most of the wagons , an almost transparent wall that shut out all not already within . Even as he tied the weave , he was not sure what it was or where it had come from some memory of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stopped . He could see people outside dimly , too many thrashing and flailing he had taken the flames , not the searing of flesh ; that stench still hung in the air but none would burn now that had not already . Bodies lay inside , too , mounds of charred cloth , some stirring feebly , moaning . She did not care ; her channeled flames winked out ; the gnats were dispelled ; she never glanced aside . <p> Heartbeats . He was cold in the emptiness of the Void , and if he felt sorrow for the dead and dying and scarred , the feeling was so far off it might not have been . He was cold itself . Emptiness itself . Only the rage of saidin filled him . <p> Movement to either side . Aviendha and Egwene , eyes concentrated on Lanfear . He had meant to shut them out from this . They must have raced with him .

" Aviendha rose on tiptoes , shuddering , howls chasing Egwene 's as they climbed higher and higher . <p> The thought was suddenly there in the emptiness . Spirit woven so , with Fire and Earth . There . Rand felt something being cut , something he could not see , and Egwene collapsed in a motionless heap , Aviendha to hands and knees , head down and swaying . <p> " No .

Two fingers stroked along her pulsing entrance . <p> " All of the girls have to go . " Her body jumped under the contact , his fingers pushing into her and finding her cl*t with lazy strokes . Each touch sent a vibration through her br**sts to her ni**les , where his teeth and tongue played . " And we have to make sure that Violet and her husband are safe .

The Myrddraal turned with them , and their eyeless faces seemed uncertain , uneasy that the fear their gaze struck into every human heart did not seem to touch these . <p> " Dance with me , Shadowman , " one of the Aiel called suddenly , tauntingly . He sounded like a young man . <p> " Dance with me , Eyeless . " That was a woman . <p> " Dance with me . " <p> " Dance with me . " <p> " I think , " Nynaeve said , straightening , " that it is time . " She threw open the door , and the three women wrapped in the glow of saidar stepped out . <p> It seemed as though , for the Myrddraal , the Aiel had ceased to exist , and for the Aiel , the Myrddraal . The Aiel stared at Egwene and the others above their veils as if not quite sure what they were seeing ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Myrddraal 's eyeless stare was different . Egwene could almost feel the Halfmen 's knowledge of their own deaths in it ; Halfmen knew women embracing the True Source when they saw them .

" I 'll take no more of this , " she growled , and unleashed a flow of Fire . <p> Flames burst out of all three Myrddraal , sprouting in every direction , and they shrieked like splintered bones jamming a meatgrinder .

" Elayne asked . <p> Nynaeve shook her head ; she looked as stunned as Elayne sounded . " I do n't know . I ... I was so angry , so afraid , at what they wanted to ... I do not know what it was . " <p> Balefire , Egwene thought . She did not know how she knew , but she was certain of it . Reluctantly , she made herself release saidar ; made it release her . She did not know which was harder .

One of the women was Aviendha . The screams and shouts outside were dying away . <p> Nynaeve still bent to check each , pulling their veils away so she could peel back eyelids and feel throats for a pulse . When she straightened from the second , her face was white . It was Dailin . " Burn you ! Burn you !

" <p> " Death comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nynaeve rounded on her , she fell silent . The Aiel exchanged glances , as if not certain whether Nynaeve might do to them what had been done to the Myrddraal . It was not fear in their eyes , only awareness . <p> " Shadowman steel kills , " Aviendha said , " it does not wound . " The older man looked at her , a slight surprise in his eyes Egwene decided that , like Lan , for this man that flicker of the eyelids was the equivalent of another man 's open astonishment and Aviendha said , " They know little of some things , Rhuarc . " <p> " I am sorry , " Elayne said in a clear voice , " that we interrupted your ... dance . Perhaps we should not have interfered .

" Perhaps we offended by putting our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a deep chuckle . " Aes Sedai , I for one am glad of ... whatever it was you did . " For a moment he looked not entirely sure of that , but in the next he had his good temper back . He had a good smile , and a strong , square face ; he was handsome , if a little old . " We could have killed them , but three Shadowmen ... They would have killed two or three of us , certainly , perhaps all , and I can not say we would have finished them all . For the young , death is an enemy they wish to try their strength against . For those of us a little older , she is an old friend , an old lover , but one we are not eager to meet again soon . " <p> Nynaeve seemed to relax with his speech , as if meeting an Aiel who did not seem anxious to die had leached the tension out of her . " I should thank you , " she said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see you , though . Aviendha , did you expect to find us here ? How ? " <p> " I followed you . " The Aiel woman seemed unembarrassed . " To see what you would do . I saw the men take you , but I was too far back to help . I was sure you must see me if I came too close , so I stayed a hundred paces behind . By the time I saw you could not help yourselves , it was too late to try alone . " <p> " I am sure you did what you could , " Egwene said faintly . She was just a hundred paces behind us ? Light , the brigands never saw anything . <p> Aviendha took her words as urging to tell more . " I knew where Corarn must be , and he knew where Dhael and Luaine were , and they knew ... " She paused , frowning at the older man . " I did not expect to find any clan chief , much less my own , among those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with you here ? " <p> Rhuarc shrugged as if it were of no account . " The sept chiefs will take their turns , and try to decide if they truly wish to go Rhuidean when I die . I would not have come , except that Amys and Bair and Melaine and Seana stalked me like ridgecats after a wild goat . The dreams said I must go . They asked if I truly wanted to die old and fat in a bed . "

The moonbeam no longer shone on the chest , but he knew now which shadow it was . He could see it in his mind , floating beyond the void , glittering golden , chased with silver , in the glow of saidin . The Horn of Valere and the dagger Mat needed , both almost within reach of his hand . Selene 's face drifted with the chest . They could follow Fain 's party in the morning , and wait until Ingtar joined them . If Ingtar did come , if he still followed the trail without his sniffer . No , there would never be a better chance . All within reach of his hand . Selene was waiting on the mountain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his belly and crawled toward the chest .

Madness ! The thought flew by dimly , almost out of reach . This is madness ! Youaregoing mad ! Dim thoughts ; someone else 's thoughts . <p> Slowly , silently , he slithered to that one special shadow , and put out a hand . Ornate traceries worked in gold met his touch . It was the chest that held the Horn of Valere . His hand touched something else , on the lid . The dagger , barebladed . In the dark , his eyes widened .

Rand allowed the void to sweep thought and fear away . Murmuring uneasily in his sleep , the man stilled . <p> Rand let his hand go back to the dagger , not quite touching it . It had not harmed Mat in the beginning . Not much , at least ; not quickly . In one swift motion he lifted the dagger , stuck it behind his belt , and pulled his hand away , as if it might help to minimize the time it touched his bare skin . Perhaps it would , and Mat would die without the dagger . He could feel it there , almost a weight pulling him down , pressing against him .

Rand reached out and took Loial 's hand . <p> The Ogier gave a start and gasped . Rand put a finger across his lips , set Loial 's hand on the chest , and mimed lifting .

Fain 's voice rose to a howl . " I know it is you , al'Thor ! You 're hiding from me , but I know you are out there ! Find him ! Find him ! Al'Thoooor !

Smoothly Rand glided between Trolloc and Ogier ; Loial must get the Horn away . Head and shoulders taller than Rand , half again as wide , the Trolloc came at him with a silent snarl . The Courtier Taps His Fan . No scream , this time . He walked backwards after Loial , watching the night . Saidin sang to him , such a sweet song . The Power could burn them all , burn Fain and all the rest to cinders . No ! <p> Two more Trollocs , wolf and ram , gleaming teeth and curling horns . Lizard in the Thornbush .

Small lines of some language he did not know surrounded each symbol , odd letters that flowed in curves and spirals , suddenly turned to jagged hooks and angles , then flowed on . At least it was not Trolloc script . Reluctantly , he put his hands on the column .

Determinedly he kept on , pushing his fears into the consuming flame , making it grow , and grow . And the void was there . <p> The core of him floated in emptiness . He could see the light saidin even with his eyes closed , feel the warmth of it , surrounding him , surrounding everything , suffusing everything . It wavered like a candle flame seen through oiled paper . Rancid oil . Stinking oil . <p> He reached for it he was not sure how he reached , but it was something , a movement , a stretching toward the light , toward saidin and caught nothing , as if running his hands through water . It felt like a slimy pond , scum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scoop up any of the water . Time and again it trickled through his fingers , not even droplets of the water remaining , only the slick scum , making his skin crawl . <p> Desperately , he tried to form an image of the hollow as it had been , with Ingtar and the lances sleeping by their horses , with Mat and Perrin , and the Stone lying buried except for one end . Outside the void he formed it , clinging to the shell of emptiness that enclosed him . He tried to link the image with the light , tried to force them together . The hollow as it had been , and he and Loial and Hurin there together . His head hurt . Together , with Mat and Perrin and the Shienarans . Burning , in his head . Together ! <p> The void shattered into a thousand razor shards , slicing his mind . <p> Shuddering , he staggered back , wideeyed . His hands hurt from pressing the Stone , and his arms and shoulders quivered with aching ; his stomach lurched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head ... He tried to steady his breathing . That had never happened before . When the void went , it went like a pricked bubble , just gone , in a twinkling . Never broken like glass . His head felt numb , as if the thousand slashes had happened so quickly the pain had not yet come . But every cut had felt as real as if done with a knife . He touched his temple , and was surprised not to see blood on his fingers . <p> Hurin still stood there watching him , still confident . If anything , the sniffer seemed more sure by the minute . Lord Rand was doing something . That was what lords were for . They protected the land and the people with their bodies and their lives , and when something was wrong , they set it aright and saw fairness and justice done . As long as Rand was doing something , anything , Hurin would have confidence that it would all come right in the end . That was what lords did .

He was still having a hard enough time coming to grips with Rand really being there . <p> Everyone in the Stone seemed to agree with the people below , or if they did not , they were not letting on . He had seen Rand just once since the night before , striding along a hall with Callandor in his hand , surrounded by a dozen veiled Aiel and trailing a cloud of Tairens , a knot of Defenders of the Stone and most of the few surviving High Lords .

There was a tall stand at one end of the room , carved and polished upright wheels of some pale , darkstriped wood with shelves slung between them so all of the shelves would stay flat as the wheels were revolved . Each shelf held a large book , bound in gold , covers set with sparkling gems . The Aiel had one of the books open and was reading . Some sort of essays , Mat thought .

The male Aiel seemed to think his efforts to get one of them alone were funny , and for that matter , so did Bain and Chiad . Women are odd , but Aiel women make odd seem normal ! <p> The great table in the middle of the room , ornately carved and gilded on edges and thick legs , had been meant for gatherings of the High Lords .

Hed loved it , though , and his submission in the bedroom was exactly what he wanted . Hed begun to think that Konnor really cared for him . <p> His ridiculous fantasies of a life as an alphas mate se emed to rise up and mock him . Was that what was really behind all the Dominance and submission play with Konnor ? That must be it . How could an omega ever be good enough for any self-respecting Lycan , let alone an important alpha like Konnor Balenescu ? <p> He thought about how tenderly Konnor made love to him each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could n't get enough of him . Yeah , right . From what he just heard , Konnor had more than enough of him . Stupid , worthless Ethan . Only a burden . What was it he said ? A great deal of trouble . Just like today . Konnor had to cut short his ride on his vetami to bring Ethan back home because he got motion sickness . <p> A stab of pain jolted his stomach like the time he was in the orphanage , and they gave him spoiled milk . Hed known it was spoiledit smelled and tasted awful , but hed been so hungry , so anxious for somethingto fill the void , hed taken the first thing he was offered . Latched onto it and gulped it down , not caring that it might ultimately sicken or even kill him . <p> Still holding himself around the waist , he eased the door open quietly and carefully slipped down the hall . There was a back exit , so it took only minutes to make his escape . He ran outside blindly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He only wanted to get away to clear his head . He ran behind the house and down toward the city center , only a few blocks away , not really caring or even noticing which direction he was moving in . <p> Konnor had told him these streets were dangerous , because of the taverns . There werent a great deal of visitors to Lycanus 2 , but they did have a few traders and businessmen coming in and out of the city . Some of these men were Voyagers , not known for their overly civilized demeanors . That must have been why Konnor had warned him about walking alone in the area , because naturally , he wanted to safeguard his property . After all , he was planning on the council selling him to the highest bidder and he would get a nice percentage for his training efforts . He said he needed the money . Another sob racked his body , and he ran blindly out into the street . <p> A strong hand grabbed his arm and pulled him back , just as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ missing him . Ethan looked up dazedly into a pair of black eyes . " Look out there , pretty boy , you were about to have an accident . " The man peered down into his face , his bushy black beard bristling . " Are you Lycan ? " <p> Ethan gazed back at him for only a moment before he closed his eyes in misery , nodding his head . " I 'm an omega , " he said softly , sagging in the mans arms . He was n't sure why he was telling him , other than the fact it was uppermost in his mind . He had to face what he was now , with no more pretense . <p> The man hissed in a breath . " A Lycan omega ? " He glanced around uneasily . " Wheres your master ? " <p> Ethan shook his head . " I do n't  have one . I do n't  belong to anyone . " <p> The man with the beard smiled , and fastened the hand on his arm more tightly . " You do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have any idea how much I can get for you ? " He put his hand on Ethans hip and drew him in closer . Ethan could smell the strong Lycan whiskey on his breath . " What 's your name , pretty thing ? Or maybe I should just call you Blondie . " <p> A strange , deep voice sounded behind the man who was holding him . " Over my dead body , you son of a bitch ! " <p> Ethan looked over the mans shoulder to see Konnor coming at them , already half shifted , his head changing into a Lycan wolf head , and his fangs and claws extending . The bearded man holding him , his face a mask of terror , shoved him away as hard as he could , right into Konnors arms . Konnor gave a terrifying growl and pushed Ethan down on the ground behind him , his claws biting into Ethans shoulders . Once he had Ethan safely on the ground , he whirled back around to go after the trader , who was running at full tilt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the scene prevented him from catching up to him and leaping on the man , tearing him apart . Nikolai did the only thing he could do to stop him . He tackled Konnor to the ground and sat on him until Konnor calmed down enough to shift back . <p> When Konnor was finally back to himself , he looked up at Nikolai . " Get off me , you big bastard . " <p> Nikolai laughed and stood up , offering Konnor his hand . " Sorry , cousin , but Lucas does n't  like it when we kill our visitors . I was only saving you from filling out all kinds of paperwork . " <p> " Yeah , whatever , " Konnor grumbled and turned a furious gaze on his mate . Ethan was still sitting on the ground where Konnor had put him and watching in fascination . " You , " Konnor said , pointing at him . " Have some explaining to do . " He jerked Ethan to his feet and held him at arms length , looking him up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did , I 'll " <p> " N-No " Ethan said in a shaky voice . " He did n't  hurt me . I 'm fine .

Or tried to steal you away ? " <p> " Then youd have lost your investment , I guess , " Ethan said in a small voice . <p> " My investment ? What in the fuck are you talking about ? " <p> " When you sell me at auction on Lycanus 2 . I heard you talking about it when I woke up . " <p> " When I " Konnor looked confused at first and then he shook his head in disbelief . " Oh , for the gods sake . " He took Ethans wrist tightly in his hand and pulled him along the street behind him . " I 'm not going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hear . Ill talk to you when I get you home , " he said gruffly , over his shoulder . <p> When they reached the house , Konnor took Ethan directly to their bedroom , pushed him in and locked the door behind him . Ethan could hear the voices of Nikolai and Jagger outside in the hallway for a while , but they gradually faded , and he heard the front door close . Everything was so quiet after that , he figured they had left , and Konnor was too angry to come and speak with him . At least thirty minutes passed before the door opened and Konnor stepped inside . He leaned back against the closed door and stared at Ethan , saying nothing for so long that Ethan got fidgety and he spoke , even though hed promised himself he would n't be the one to say anything first . <p> " Well , are you just going to stand there and stare at me ? " Ethan asked , irritation evident in his voice . <p> " You do n't  really want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to be calm . " <p> " Why , or you might beat me ? Isnt that what you like to do ? Why deny yourself the pleasure ? What do my feelings mean anyway ? I 'm just a slave . " <p> " Ethan , Nikolai warned me not to discipline you while I 'm so angry , but you 're making it very hard . You remember what I told you I 'd do to you if you ever ran away from me again ? " <p> " S-Spank me ? " His voice shook a little , but he squared his shoulders , stood up and leaned over the bed . " Well , go ahead . I 'm not afraid of you . " <p> " Oh really ? " Konnor said , walking slowly toward him . He took hold of the waistband of Ethans pants and pulled them down to his knees in one rough motion . He put a hand on the curve of Ethans hip and let his fingers trail over his ass gently . " Anything youd like to say , Ethan ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A hard slap landed on his ass cheek and Ethan winced , but stood still . " One more chance . Tell me why you ran away from me again . " <p> " No . " Another hard slap came down on his bottom , and Ethan let out a single sob . <p> " Oh , damn it ! " Konnor pulled him around to face him . " Stop fucking around , Blondie . I want to know what 's going on with you , and if you do n't  tell me , I swear I 'll " <p> " Beat me ? Sell me at auction ? " <p> " Thats the second time you said that . What is going on in that head of yours ? " <p> Ethan cast a hurt gaze up to him . " Why did n't  you just tell me I was n't really your mate ? Why did you have to lie about it ? " <p> " Not my mate ? What do you mean ? " <p> " Oh , stop pretending , Konnor . I overheard you talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I heard you tell them how you planned to sell me at the slave auction . " <p> A light seemed to dawn on Konnors face . " Not you , damn it . I was talking about selling the vetami . There are auctions for livestock on Lycanus 2 every month , and I decided to sell the vetami . No sense in keeping him if you get sick when you ride . I 'm not home enough to make it worth the money to stable him anyway . He s an expensive luxury I do n't  need , especially if I cant enjoy riding him with you . "

The honeyhaired Aes Sedai was staring straight ahead , rosebud lips pursed thoughtfully . She appeared to have forgotten Moiraine and Anaiya both . What is she up to ? <p> Anaiya seemed not to have noticed anything out of the ordinary , but then she always managed to accept people both as they were and as they wanted to be .

" The world is becoming more dangerous every day , even for a queen . Perhaps especially for a queen . She was ever headstrong . I remember when she came to Tar Valon as a girl .

Would the people of Andor knowingly accept Elayne on the Lion Throne after Morgase if they knew ? Not just a queen trained in Tar Valon according to custom , but a full Aes Sedai ? In all of recorded history there had been only a handful of queens with the right to be called Aes Sedai , and the few who let it be known had all lived to regret it . She felt a touch of sadness .

He balled up his fist and slammed a stiff jab into my belly that took the wind out of my sails and half dropped me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You are n't going to laugh this off , traitor . " He stepped into my apartment . The threshold did n't make him blink . The wards I had up caught him six inches later , but they were n't designed to be too much of an impediment to human beings . Morgan grunted , spoke a harsh word in a guttural tongue , maybe Old German , and slashed his hand in front of him . The air hissed and popped with static electricity , sparks flashing from his fingertips . He shook his fingers briefly , then walked in . <p> He looked around the place and shook his head again . " Dresden , you might not be a bad person , all in all . But I think that you 're compromised . If you are n't working with the Red Court , then I am certain that they are using you . Either way , the threat to the Council is the same . And it 's best removed by removing you . " <p> I tried to suck in a breath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are you talking about ? " <p> " They turned her , Dresden . No one goes back . That 's all there is to it . " <p> " They have n't . She 's not . " <p> Morgan shrugged . " That 's what you would say if she 'd addicted you to the venom . You 'd say or do just about anything for them by now . " <p> I looked up at him , teeth bared . " Get the fuck out of my house . " <p> He walked over to the fireplace and picked up a dust-covered gift card I 'd left sitting on the mantel . He read it and snorted . Then he picked up a picture I had of Susan . " Pretty , " he said . " But that 's easy to come by . Odds are she was their pawn from the first day she met you . " <p> I clenched my hands into fists . " You shut your mouth , " I said . " You just shut your mouth about her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're a fool , Dresden . A young fool . Do you really think that a normal mortal woman would want anything to do with you or your life ? You ca n't accept that she was just a tool . One of their whores . " <p> I spun to the corner , letting go of my staff , and picked up my sword cane . I drew the blade free with a steely rasp and turned toward Morgan . He saw it coming and had already drawn the bright silver blade of the Wardens from the golf bag . <p> Every tired , aching , angry bone in my body wanted to lunge at him . I 'm not heavy with muscle , but I 'm not slow , and I 've got arms and legs miles long . My lunge is quick , and I can do it from a long way back . Morgan was a seasoned soldier , but in such close quarters it would be a question of reflexes . Advantage to the guy with the sword weighed in ounces instead of stones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could have killed him . He might have taken me with him , but I could have done it . And I wanted to , badly . Not in any sort of intellectual sense , but in the part of the brain that does all of its thinking after the fact . My temper had frayed to bloody tatters , and I wanted to vent it on Morgan . <p> But a thought snuck in past the testosterone and spoiled my rage . I stopped myself . Shaking , and with my knuckles white on my sword cane , I drew myself up straight . And I said , very quietly , " That 's number three . " <p> Morgan 's brow furrowed , and he stared at me , his own weapon steadily extended toward me . " What are you talking about , Dresden ? " <p> " The third plan . The Merlin 's ace in the hole . He sent you here to pick a fight with me . With my door still standing open . There 's another Warden outside , listening , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a clean kill . Hand the body over to the vampires . End of problem , right ? " <p> Morgan 's eyes widened . He stammered over the first word . " I do n't know what you 're talking about . " <p> I picked up the sheath half of the sword cane and slipped the blade back into it . " Sure , you do n't . Get out , Morgan . Unless you 'd prefer to stab an unarmed man who is n't offering you violence . " <p> Morgan stared at me for a moment more . Then he shoved the sword back into the golf bag , swung it onto his shoulder , and headed for the door . <p> He was almost out when there was a clunk from my bedroom . I shot a look at the doorway . <p> Morgan stopped . He looked at me and then at my bedroom . Something ugly sparkled in his gaze . " Who is in the bedroom , Dresden ? The vampire girl , perhaps ? " <p> " No one , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We 'll see , " Morgan said . He turned and walked to my bedroom door , one hand still on the sword . " You and those who consort with your like will be brought to task very soon . I 'm looking forward to it . " <p> My heart started pounding again . If Morgan found Elaine , there were about a million things that might happen , and none of them were good . There seemed little I could do , though . I could n't warn her , and I could n't think of a way to get Morgan out of my apartment any faster . <p> Morgan peered through the doorway and looked around , then abruptly let out a hoarse cry and jumped back . At the same time , there was a harsh feline yowl , and Mister , my bobtailed grey cat , came zooming out of the bedroom . He darted between Morgan 's legs and then streaked past him , out of the apartment and up the stairs into the summer evening . <p> Morgan straightened , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door . " The Senior Council members wish me to tell you that they will be nearby but that they will not interfere in this Trial or aid you in any way . " He took a business card out of his shirt pocket and let it fall to the floor . " That 's the contact number for the Senior Council . Use it when you have failed the Trial . " <p> " Do n't let the door hit you on the brain on the way out , " I responded . <p> Morgan glared at me as he left . He slammed the door behind him and stomped up the stairs . <p> I started trembling maybe half a minute after he left - reaction to the stress . At least I had n't done it in front of him . I turned around , leaned back against the door with my eyes closed , and folded my arms over my chest . It was easier not to feel myself shaking that way . <p> Another minute or two passed before I heard Elaine move quietly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Are they gone ? " Elaine asked . Her voice was very carefully steady . <p> " Yeah . Though I would n't put it past them to watch my place . " <p> I felt her fingers touch my shoulder . " You 're shaking , Harry . " <p> " I 'll be all right . " <p> " You could have killed him , " Elaine said . " When you first drew . " <p> " Yeah . " <p> " Was he really setting you up like you said ? " <p> I looked at her . Her expression was worried . " Yeah , " I said . <p> " God , Harry . " She shook her head . " That 's way past paranoia . And you want me to give myself to those people ? " <p> I covered her hand with mine . " Not to them , " I said . " Not everyone on the Council is like that . " <p> She looked at my eyes for a moment . Then , carefully , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No . I 'm not going to make myself vulnerable to men like that . Not again . " <p> " Elaine , " I protested . <p> She shook her head . " I 'm leaving , Harry . " She brushed her hair back from her face . " Are you going to tell them ? " <p> I took a deep breath . If the Wardens found out that Elaine was still alive and avoiding them , there would be a literal witch-hunt . The Wardens were n't exactly known for their tolerance and understanding . Morgan was walking , talking proof of that . Anyone who helped shield her from the Wardens would get the same treatment . Did n't I already have enough problems ? <p> " No , " I said . " Of course not . " <p> Elaine gave me a strained smile . " Thank you , Harry . " She lifted her staff closer to her , holding it with both hands . " Can you get the door for me ? " <p> " They 're going to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They wo n't see me . " <p> " They 're good . " <p> She shrugged and said without emphasis , " I 'm better . I 've had practice . " <p> I shook my head . " What are we going to do about the faeries ? " <p> " I do n't know , " she said . " I 'll be in touch . " <p> " How can I contact you ? " <p> She nodded toward the door . I opened it . She stepped up beside me and kissed my cheek again , her lips warm . " You 're the one with the office and the answering service . I 'll contact you . " Then she stepped to the door , murmuring quietly under her breath . There was a glitter of sudden silver light around her that made me blink . When I opened my eyes again , she was gone . <p> I left the door open for a moment , and it was just as well that I did . Mister came padding back down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a plaintive meow . He prowled back into the apartment , curling around my legs and purring like a diesel engine .

I could smell her lingering perfume , and it brought with it a pang of almost tangible memories , a flood of things I thought I had forgotten . It made me feel old , and tired , and very alone . <p> I walked to the mantel and straightened the card Susan had sent me the previous Christmas . I looked at her picture , next to the card . She 'd been in a park that weekend , wearing a blue tank top and cutoff shorts .

With so many exclaiming over their strength everyone said she and Elayne would be among the strongest Aes Sedai , if not the strongest , in a thousand years or more she had assumed they were as strong as he . Near to it , at least . She had just been rudely disabused . Perhaps Nynaeve could come close , if she was angry enough , but Egwene knew she herself could never have done what he just had , split her flows that many ways , worked that many things at once . Working two flows at once was far more than twice as hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three much more than twice again working two . He had to have been weaving a dozen . He did not even look tired , yet exertion with the Power took energy . She very much feared he could handle her and Elayne both like kittens . Kittens he might decide to drown , if he went mad . <p> But she would not , could not , just walk away . That would be the same as quitting , and she was not made that way . She meant to do what she had come there for all of it and he was not going to chase her off short of it . Not him or anything else . <p> Elayne 's blue eyes were filled with determination , and the moment Egwene fell silent she added in a much firmer voice , " And we will not go until we are . You said you would try . You must try . " <p> " I did say that , did n't I ? " he murmured after a time . " At least we can sit down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the band of metallic cloth lying crumpled on the carpet , he led them , limping slightly , to highbacked chairs near the windows . They had to move books from the red silk cushions in order to sit ; Egwene 's chair held Volume Twelve of The Treasures of the Stone of Tear , a dusty , woodbound book entitled Travels in the Aiel Waste , with Various Observations on the Savage Inhabitants , and a thick , tattered leather volume called Dealings with the Territory of Mayene , 500 to 750 of the New Era . Elayne had a bigger stack to move , but Rand hurriedly took them from her along with those from his chair and put them all on the floor , where the pile promptly fell over . Egwene laid hers neatly beside them . <p> " What do you want me to do now ? " He sat on the edge of his seat , hands on his knees . " I promise I wo n't do anything but what you ask this time . " <p> Egwene bit her tongue to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perhaps she had been a little vague in what she had asked for , but that was no excuse . Still , that was something to be dealt with another time . She realized she was thinking of him as just Rand again , but he looked as if he had just splashed mud on her best dress and was worried she would not believe it an accident . Yet she had not let go of saidar , and neither had Elayne . There was no need to be foolish . " This time , " she said , " we just want you to talk . How do you embrace the Source ? Just tell us . Take it step by step , slowly . " <p> " More like wrestling than embracing . " He grunted . " Step by step ? Well , first I imagine a flame , and then I push everything into it . Hate , fear , nervousness . Everything . When they 're all consumed , there 's an emptiness , a void , inside my head . I am in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever I am concentrating on , too . " <p> " That sounds familiar , " Egwene said . " I 've heard your father talk about a trick of concentration he uses to win the archery competitions . What he calls the Flame and the Void . " <p> Rand nodded ; sadly , it seemed . She thought he must be missing home , and his father . " Tam taught it to me first . And Lan uses it , too , with the sword . Selene someone I met once called it the Oneness . A good many people seem to know about it , whatever they call it . But I found out for myself that when I was inside the void , I could feel saidin , like a light just beyond the corner of my eye in the emptiness . There 's nothing but me and that light . Emotion , even thought , is outside . I used to have to take it bit by bit , but it all comes at once , now . Most of it does , anyway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Elayne said with a shiver . " No emotion . That does n't sound very much like what we do . " <p> " Yes , it does , " Egwene insisted eagerly . " Rand , we just do it a little differently , that 's all . I imagine myself to be a flower , a rosebud , imagine it until I am the rosebud . That is like your void , in a way . The rosebud 's petals open out to the light of saidar , and I let it fill me , all light and warmth and life and wonder . I surrender to it , and by surrendering , I control it . That was the hardest part , to learn , really ; how to master saidar by submitting , but it seems so natural now that I do not even think about it . That is the key to it , Rand . I am sure . You must learn to surrender " He was shaking his head vigorously . <p> " That 's nothing like what I do , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have to reach out and take hold of saidin . Sometimes there 's still nothing there when I do , nothing I can touch , but if I did n't reach for it , I could stand there forever and nothing would happen . It fills me all right , once I take hold , but surrender to it ? " He raked his fingers through his hair . " Egwene , if I surrendered even for a minute saidin would consume me . It 's like a river of molten metal , an ocean of fire , all the light of the sun gathered in one spot . I must fight it to make it do what I want , fight it to keep from being eaten up . " <p> He sighed . " I know what you mean about life filling you , though , even with the taint turning my stomach . Colors are sharper , smells clearer . Everything is more real , somehow . I do n't want to let go , once I have it , even while it 's trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Egwene . The Tower is right about this . Accept it for the truth , because it is . " <p> She shook her head . " I will accept it when it is proved to me . " She did not sound as sure as she wanted to , not as sure she had been . What he told sounded like some twisted halfreflection of what she did , similarities only emphasizing differences . Yet there were similarities . She would not give up . " Can you tell the flows apart ? Air , Water , Spirit , Earth , Fire ? " <p> " Sometimes , " he said slowly . " Not usually . I just take what I need to do what I want . Fumble for it , mostly . It 's very strange . Sometimes I need to do a thing , and I do it , but only afterward do I know what it was I did , or how . It 's almost like remembering something I 've forgotten . But I can remember how to do it again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do remember how , " she insisted . " How did you set fire to those tables ? " She wanted to ask him how he had made them dance she thought she saw a way , with Air and Water but she wanted to start with something simple ; lighting a candle and putting it out were things a novice could do . <p> Rand 's face took on a pained expression . " I do n't know . " He sounded embarrassed . " When I want fire , for a lamp or a fireplace , I just make it , but I do not know how . I do n't really need to think to do things with fire . " <p> That almost stood to reason . Of the Five Powers , Fire and Earth had been strongest in men in the Age of Legends , and Air and Water in women ; Spirit had been shared equally . Egwene hardly had to think to use Air or Water , once she had learned to do a thing in the first place . But the thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Elayne who pressed him . " Do you know how you extinguished them ? You seemed to think before they went out . " 
@@37757049 @6757049/ <p> AS TOM WATCHED the moonlight reflect off the ice-covered lake , he had a reflection of his own : the world really needed more snow . <p> Sure , people paid lip service to the threat of global warming , tsk-ing and tutting and pointing at the glanciers receding right over in Kenai Fjords . But in their hearts , they were n't convinced that a warmer climate was such a bad thing , especially at this time of year , late March , with harsh months of Alaskan winter behind them , and weeks more to go . <p> But Tom liked snow . God 's Ajax , he called it . Divine cleansing powder . When spring thaw came , this lake and field would be one big swamp , nothing but mud and mosquitoes and the decaying corpses of every beast that had n't survived the winter . For these few months , though , it was as pristine a wilderness as any poet might imagine . <p> A field of unbroken white glittered under a half-moon . The air was so crisp it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tom could hear mice tunneling under the drifts and the howling of wolves ten miles off . <p> Tom liked wolves even more than he liked snow . Beautiful , proud creatures . Perfect hunters , gliding through the night , silent as ghosts . <p> The first animal he 'd ever trapped had been a wolf cub . He still remembered it , lying in a halo of blood on the newly fallen snow , lips drawn back in a final snarl of defiance , its leg half chewed off as it had tried to escape . Even as a boy , Tom had respected that defiance , that will to survive . When his dad had said the pelt was too damaged to sell , Tom had asked his mother to make him mitts out of it . <p> He still had those mitts . He 'd planned to pass them on to his son but well , forty-six was n't too old yet , but there just were n't enough women to go around up here . Anchorage was n't as bad as Fairbanks , but when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a cabin thirty miles from town , you 'd better look like Brad Pitt if you hoped to get yourself a wife . <p> Another wolf pack 's song joined the first , and as Tom listened , he wondered whether one of those was his pack , the one that used to run in this field . For twenty years , he 'd been able to count on pelts from them . Not many-he did n't trap wolves anymore , only shot them , being careful to target the old and sick , like a proper scavenger should . <p> He 'd hear them when he came to empty his traps , their howls so close he 'd grip his rifle a little tighter . They never bothered him , though-just let him go about his business . <p> He 'd see their tracks , crisscrossing through the snow , and he 'd find their kills picked clean to the last bone . Now and then , he 'd even catch a glimpse of them , silently slipping through the trees . Once , on a winter 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out on the ice , even the old ones tumbling and sliding like puppies . <p> But then , a few months back they 'd left this little valley . <p> Now those distant wolf howls stopped , and when they did , Tom realized how quiet it was . Unnaturally quiet . Folks talked about the silence of the Alaskan wilderness , yet anyone who spent any time there knew it was anything but silent , with the constant rush of wind and running water , the scampering of feet over and under the snow , the call of predators and the cries of prey . Right now , though , Tom could swear even the wind had stopped . <p> And if you 've been out here long enough , you know this , too-that true silence means only one thing : trouble . <p> Tom lowered his pack to the ground and lifted his rifle , gripping it with both hands like a Samurai with his sword . Not that Tom fooled himself into thinking a gun made him a warrior . Out here he was just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> When a shadow rippled between the trees , he held perfectly still and tracked it by pivoting slowly , his rifle rising a few more inches . <p> The two worst mistakes you could make in the forest were complacency and panic . As hard as he looked , though , he caught only a glimpse of a big shape , hunched onto all fours . Then it was gone . <p> A bear ? They rarely bothered with humans outside of cub season . And when bears took off , they made a helluva racket , especially when they had just come out of hibernation . Tom had n't heard a thing . <p> The hair on his neck rose as old stories and legends crept through his mind . There were parts of this forest you could n't pay some of the Inuit elders to hunt in . This was Ijiraat territory , they 'd say , the hunting grounds of shapeshifters who took the form of wolf and bear , and protected their land against all comers . Tales for children , Tom told himself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took a step , his boots crunching in the snow . A shape moved in the trees , closer now , and Tom brought his rifle all the way to his shoulder , gloved finger to the trigger . <p> Clouds slid over the moon and the forest went black . A twig cracked to his left and Tom swore he felt hot breath on the back of his neck . When he spun , nothing was there . <p> He took one band off the rifle and fumbled in his pocket for the flashlight . It caught in the folds and when he wrenched , it flew out and sailed into the surrounding darkness . <p> The brush crackled to his right now . He spun again , finger still on the trigger , and this time he saw a faint shape . He was about to fire when he thought of Danny Royce . Another trapper , Danny had been spooked by shadows in this same valley just last summer and he 'd fired his gun , only to find that he 'd shot some kid , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had buried the body and no one ever found it , but Danny had n't been the same since-not sleeping , drinking too much and talking too much , blabbing his story to Tom like a sinner at confession , swearing the boy 's ghost was stalking him . Tom knew the only thing stalking Danny Royce was guilt , but still , the story kept him from pulling the trigger . <p> The shape had vanished . Tom held his breath , scanning the woods for any change in the shadows . Then he saw it , at least twenty feet away now , a huge shape between two trees . The cloud cover thinned enough for the moon to glimmer through and he could see the shape , too pale for a bear . <p> Tom hunkered down as slowly as he could , and with his freehand , he began feeling around for the flashlight . He allowed himself one glance at the ground and saw it there , dark against the snow . He scooped it up . His finger found the switch . The click @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whacked the flashlight against his thigh and tried again . Nothing . <p> Something landed on his back , hitting him so hard that at first he thought he 'd been shot . He lost his grip on the rifle . A blast of hot breath seared his neck , and a weight pinned him to the snow . <p> As the thing flipped him over , the flashlight bounced off a tree and flicked on just when fangs tore into his throat . Tom caught a glimpse of yellow fur and glittering blue eyes , and his last thought was That 's not one of my wolves .
